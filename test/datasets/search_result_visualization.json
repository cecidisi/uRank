We investigate how coordinated visualizations can enhance search and exploration of information on the World Wide Web by easing the formulation of these types of queries. Drawing from visual information seeking and exploratory search, we introduce VisGets--interactive query visualizations of Web-based information that operate with online information within a Web browser. VisGets provide the information seeker with visual overviews of Web resources and offer a way to visually filter the data. Our goal is to facilitate the construction of dynamic search queries that combine filters from more than one data dimension. We present a prototype information exploration system featuring three linked VisGets (temporal, spatial, and topical), and used it to visually explore news items from online RSS feeds."

Taking into account information about a user, adaptive visualization attempts to provide user-adapted visual presenta- tion of information. This paper proposes Adaptive VIBE, an approach for adap- tive visualization of search results in an intelligence analysis context. Adaptive VIBE extends the popular VIBE visualization framework by infusing user model terms as reference points for spatial document arrangement and manipula- tion. We explored the value of the proposed approach using data obtained froma user study. The result demonstrated that user modeling and spatial visu- alization technologies are able to reinforce each other, creating an enhanced level of user support. Spatial visualization amplifies the user model's ability to separate relevant and non-relevant documents, whereas user modeling adds valuable reference points to relevance-based spatial visualization.

However, the majority of studies on personalized search focused on a rather simple type of search, which leaves an important research topic – the personalization in exploratory searches – as an under-studied area. In this paper, we present a study of personalization in task- based information exploration using a system called TaskSieve. TaskSieve is a Web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based profile, called a “task model”, for personalization. Its innovations include flexible and user controlled integration of queries and task models, task-infused text snippet generation, and on-screen visualization of task models. Through an empirical study using human subjects conducting task-based exploration searches, we demonstrate that TaskSieve pushes significantly more relevant documents to the top of search result lists as compared to a traditional search system. TaskSieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks, allows the users to do so with higher productivity, and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics."

We first carry out a user study to evaluate the clustering/ranked list combination on instance-oriented retrieval, the task of the TREC-6 Interactive Track. We find that although users generally prefer the combination, they are not able to use it to improve effectiveness. In the second half of this study, we develop and evaluate an approach that more directly combines the ranked list with information from inter-document similarities. Using the TREC collections and relevance judgments, we show that it is possible to realize substantial improvements in effectiveness by doing so, and that although users can use the combined information effectively, the system can provide hints that substantially improve on the user's solo effort. The resulting approach shares much in common with an interactive application of incremental relevance feedback. Throughout this study, we illustrate our work using two prototype systems constructed for these evaluations. The first, AspInQuery, is a classic information retrieval system augmented with a specialized tool for recording information about instances of relevance. The other system, Lighthouse, is a Web-based application that combines a ranked list with a portrayal of inter-document similarity. Lighthouse can work with collections such as TREC, as well as the results of Web search engines."

This study, within contrasting departments (Humanities, Computing and Business) of a London university, reviews the social and organisational impacts of DLs across these disciplines. In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to gather data from 25 lecturers and librarians, and results analysed using the grounded theory method. Webaccessible DLs are identified as changing the roles and working patterns of academic staff (i.e. lecturers, librarians and computer support staff). However, poor accessibility due to inappropriate implementation strategies, access mechanisms, searching support & DL usability reduces the use of these resources. Consequently, web and personal collections without guarantees of quality are widely used as an accessible alternative. One conclusion is the importance of implementation strategies (e.g. giving feedback on document context, collection boundaries, ownership, accountability and support) in informing DL design."

Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and are visualised as stars, forming clusters with distinct shapes. For greater performance, the hierarchical structure is exploited and force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on much fewer objects, rather than on the whole corpus. Collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised with bounding polygons using a modified weighted Voronoi diagram. Their area is related to the number of documents contained. Textual labels are displayed dynamically during navigation, adjusting to the visualisation content. Navigation is animated and provides a seamless zooming transition between summary and detail view. Users can map metadata such as document size or age to attributes of the visualisation such as colour and luminance. Queries can be made and matching documents or collections are highlighted. Formative usability testing is ongoing; a small baseline experiment comparing the telescope browser to a tree browser is discussed."

This approach has been implemented in a system named VIEWER (VIEwing WEb Results), acting as an inter- face to available search engines. An experimental eval- uation of the performance of VIEWER in contrast to AltaVista is the major focus of the paper. We first re- port the results of an experiment on single, short query searches where VIEWER, used as an interactive rank- ing system, markedly outperformed AltaVista. We then concentrate on a more realistic searching scenario, in- volving free query formulation, unconstrained selection of retrieval results, and possibility of query reformulation. We report the results of an experiment where the use of VIEWER, compared to AltaVista, seemed to shift the user effort from inspection to evaluation of results, in- creasing retrieval effectiveness, and user satisfaction. In particular, we found that the VIEWER users retrieved half as many nonrelevant documents as the AltaVista users while retrieving a comparable number of relevant documents."

Whether they are fighting crime, curing diseases, deciding what car to buy, or researching a new field, inevitably investigators will encounter text documents. Taking a visual analytics approach, we integrate multiple text analysis algorithms with a suite of interactive visualizations to provide a flexible and powerful environment that allows analysts to explore collections of documents while sensemaking. Our particular focus is on the process of integrating automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner. We illustrate this integration through two example scenarios: an academic researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a consumer exploring car reviews while pondering a purchase decision. Finally, we provide lessons learned toward the design and implementation of visual analytics systems for document exploration and understanding."

These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text."

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm."

Our system, FeatureLens1, visualizes a text collection at several levels of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns. The current implementation focuses on frequent itemsets of n-grams, as they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection. Users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing them within and across documents in the collection. This also permits users to identify the temporal evolution of usage such as increasing, decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns. The interface could be used to explore other text features as well. Initial studies suggest that FeatureLens helped a literary scholar and 8 users generate new hypotheses and interesting insights using 2 text collections. Categories"

Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query--for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed--the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a \"bag-of-words\" vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown."

As a consequence, many underlying assumptions must be altered for retrieval from full-length text collections. This paper argues for making use of text structure when retrieving from full text documents, and presents a visualization paradigm, called TileBars, that demonstrates the usefulness of explicit term distribution information in Boolean-type queries. TileBars simultaneously and compactly indicate relative document length, query term frequency, and query term distribution. The patterns in a column of TileBars can be quickly scanned and deciphered, aiding users in making judgments about the potential relevance of the retrieved documents."

Even when they provide a good query, users often find it challenging to evaluate the results of their web searches. Sources of these problems include the lack of support for query refine- ment, and the static nature of the list-based representations of web search results. To address these issues, we have developed WordBars, an interactive tool for web informa- tion retrieval. WordBars visually represents the frequencies of the terms found in the first 100 document surrogates re- turned from the initial query. This system allows the users to interactively re-sort the search results based on the fre- quencies of the selected terms within the document surro- gates, as well as to add and remove terms from the query, generating a new set of search results. Examples illustrate how WordBars can provide valuable support for query re- finement and search results exploration, both when specific and vague initial queries are provided."

Although the list-based representation makes it easy to evaluate a single document for relevance, it does not support the users in the broader tasks of manipulating or exploring the search results as they attempt to find a collection of relevant documents. HotMap is a meta-search sys- tem that provides a compact visual representation of Web search results at two levels of detail, and it sup- ports interactive exploration via nested sorting of Web search results based on query term frequencies. An eval- uation of the search results for a set of vague queries has shown that the re-sorted search results can provide a higher portion of relevant documents among the top search results. User studies show an increase in speed and effectiveness and a reduction in missed documents when comparing HotMap to the list-based representa- tion used by Google. Subjective measures were positive, and users showed a preference for the HotMap interface. These results provide evidence for the utility of next- generation Web search results interfaces that promote interactive search results exploration. In"

Although this list-based representa- tion makes it easy to evaluate a single document, it does not support the users in the broader tasks of manipulating the search results, comparing documents, or finding a set of rel- evant documents. HotMap provides a compact visual rep- resentation of web search results at two levels of detail, and supports the interactive exploration of web search results. User studies have shown that HotMap can result in fewer low-relevance documents being considered, and generates a higher level of confidence, ease of use, and satisfaction than a Google-like interface."

In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (“tiles”). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of useful- ness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 partic- ipants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, As- pecTiles affects the user’s information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multi- aspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found Aspec- Tiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search per- formance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified. ∗This"

Unlike existing work in visual text analytics, which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel text visualization metaphors, ours tightly integrates state-of-the-art text an- alytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this article, we present our work from two aspects. We first introduce an enhanced, LDA-based topic analysis technique that automatically derives a set of topics to summarize a collection of documents and their content evolution over time. To help users understand the complex summarization results produced by our topic analysis technique, we then present the design and development of a time-based visualization of the results. Furthermore, we provide users with a set of rich interaction tools that help them further interpret the visualized results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a result, our work offers three unique con- tributions. First, we present an enhanced topic modeling technique to provide users with a time-sensitive and more meaningful text summary. Second, we develop an effective visual metaphor to transform abstract and often complex text summarization results into a comprehensible visual representation. Third, we offer users flexible visual interaction tools as alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text sum- marization techniques. We have applied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows promise, especially in support of complex text analyses."

Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations on metrics and techniques for evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis."

Based on extensive user tests the original visualizations have been redesigned in two different design variants. Instead of offering multiple visualizations to choose from the Su- perTable + Scatterplot combines them in a new way.

These tools aid information analysts in interacting with and understanding large textual information content through visual interfaces. By developing a parallel implementation of the text processing engine, we enabled visual analytics tools to exploit cluster architectures and handle massive datasets. The paper describes key elements of our parallelization approach and demonstrates virtually linear scaling when processing multi-gigabyte data sets such as Pubmed. This approach enables interactive analysis of large datasets beyond capabilities of existing state-of-the art visual analytics tools."

The metaphor in our model is the solar system with its planets and asteroids revolving around the sun. Location, color, movement, and spatial distance of objects in the visual space are used to represent the semantic relationships between a query and relevant Web pages. Especially, the movement of objects and their speeds add a new dimension to the visual space, illustrating the degree of relevance among a query and Web search results in the context of users' subjects of interest. By interacting with the visual space, users are able to observe the semantic relevance between a query and a resulting Web page with respect to their subjects of interest, context information, or concern. Users' subjects of interest can be dynamically changed, redefined, added, or deleted from the visual space."

The visual- ization uses a focus+context (fisheye) technique that works effectively on tabular information because it allows display of crucial label information and multiple distal focal areas. In addition, a graphical mapping scheme for depicting table contents has been developed for the most widespread kind of tables, the cases-by-variables table. The Table Lens fuses symbolic and graphical representations into a single coherent view that can be fluidly adjusted by the user. This fusion and interactivity enables an extremely rich and natural style of direct manipulation exploratory data analysis. KEYWORDS:"

TheWeb can be seen as one huge digital library offering a variety of very useful information for business analysts. INSYDER addresses these possibilities and offers power- ful retrieval and visualisation functionalities. The main focus during the development was on the usability of the system. Therefore, a variety of well-established visual- isation components were employed to support the user during the information-seeking process (e.g. visual query, result table, bar graph, segment view with tile bars, and scatterplot). Also, the retrieval aspects were developed with the goal of increasing the usability of the system(e.g. natural language search, content-based classification, rel- evance feedback). Extensive evaluations of the retrieval performance and the usability of the visualisation were conducted. The results of these evaluations offered many helpful insights into developing a new visual-information- seeking system called VisMeB. Keywords:"

However, for exploratory search in which users need to learn, discover, and understand novel or complex topics, there is substantial room for improvement. Human computer interaction researchers and web browser designers have developed novel strategies to improve Web search by enabling users to conveniently visualize, manipulate, and organize their Web search results. This monograph offers fresh ways to think about search-related cognitive processes and describes innovative design approaches to browsers and related tools. For instance, while key word search presents users with results for specific information (e.g., what is the capitol of Peru), other methods may let users see and explore the contexts of their requests for information (related or previous work, conflicting information), or the properties that associate groups of information assets (group legal decisions by lead attorney). We also consider the both traditional and novel ways in which these strategies have been evaluated. From our review of cognitive processes, browser design, and evaluations, we reflect on the future opportunities and new paradigms for exploring and interacting with Web search results."

Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes in- creasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose FacetScape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the FacetScape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space."

The popular search engines do not, how- ever, present the relevance scores that were computed during this process. We suggest that these relevance scores may contain infor- mation that can help users make conscious decisions. In this paper we evaluate in a user study how users react to the display of such scores. The results indicate that users understand graphical dis- plays of relevance, and make decisions based on these scores. Our results suggest that in the context of exploratory search, relevance scores may cause users to explore more search results."

A hierarchy of aggregation is employed to provide users with quick insights into the number of documents found by a specific number or combination of search engines. MetaCrystal enables users to visually perform advanced filtering operations, such as complex Boolean constraints.

As the number of documents and the corre- sponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine them more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents."

Many such searches are executed against PubMed, a central repository of life sciences articles, and often re- turn hundreds, or even thousands, of results, pointing to the need for data exploration tools. In this demonstration we present Sky- lineSearch, a semantic ranking and result visualization system de- signed specifically for PubMed, and available to the scientific com- munity at skyline.cs.columbia.edu. Our system lever- ages semantic annotations of articles with terms from the MeSH controlled vocabulary, and presents results as a two-dimensional skyline, plotting relevance against publication date. We demon- strate that SkylineSearch supports a richer data exploration experi- ence than does the search functionality of PubMed, allowing users to find relevant references more easily. We also show that Skyline- Search executes queries and presents results in interactive time."

We present an alternative based on enabling users to navigate along conceptual dimensions that describe the images. The interface makes use of hierarchical faceted metadata and dynamically generated query previews. A usability study, in which 32 art history students explored a collection of 35,000 fine arts images, compares this approach to a standard image search interface. Despite the unfamiliarity and power of the interface (attributes that often lead to rejection of new search interfaces), the study results show that 90% of the participants preferred the metadata approach overall, 97% said that it helped them learn more about the collection, 75% found it more flexible, and 72% found it easier to use than a standard baseline system. These results indicate that a category-based approach is a successful way to provide access to image collections."

Taking into account information about a user, adaptive visualization attempts to provide user-adapted visual presentation of information. This paper proposes Adaptive VIBE, an approach for adaptive visualization of search results in an intelligence analysis context. Adaptive VIBE extends the popular VIBE visualization framework by infusing user model terms as reference points for spatial document arrangement and manipulation. We explored the value of the proposed approach using data obtained from a user study. The result demonstrated that user modeling and spatial visualization technologies are able to reinforce each other, creating an enhanced level of user support. Spatial visualization amplifies the user model's ability to separate relevant and non-relevant documents, whereas user modeling adds valuable reference points to relevance-based spatial visualization."

While many of these routines are focused on hierarchical clustering, little has been done toward an effective visualization of such data. Due to the richness of information observed in 3D in comparison with 2D (because of its abundant visual cues), we have proposed an intuitive 3D metaphor for the visualization of hierarchical clustered results. Our metaphor is based on fractal trees which are usually constructed by linear recursive algorithms traversing node-link hierarchies. The search results of different hierarchical clustering algorithms shall be visualized as either single-tree or forest metaphors which are user's customizable alternatives in our implemented prototype. In the forest depiction, our approach is even applicable to flat clustered results."

In order to manage this size of repository, it is often essential to structure the repository according to a thematic classification hierarchy. InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore such large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. The hierarchical structure is represented by recursive Voronoi subdivision of the available space. At each level, larger subcollections are assigned more space and related subcollections gravitate towards one another. Individual documents at each level of the hierarchy are represented by stars placed according to their similarity. Finally, InfoSky extracts and displays descriptors describing the essential theme of each subcollection at each level of the hierarchy."

The challenges in formulating effective queries are emphasized in web information search, because the web is used by a diverse population varying in their levels of expertise. In this paper, the factors affecting query formulation in web information search were studied. The data was collected via a questionnaire (32 participants, each formulated 20 queries). The results of the study suggested that experience in using computers, web, and web search engines affect the query formulation process. Surprisingly, domain expertise did not have an effect on the query formulation. Generally, experienced users formulated longer and more specific queries whereas the queries of users with less experience consisted of fewer and more generic terms. Based on the previous studies concerning query formulation and the results from the questionnaire study, three main factors affecting query formulation are suggested: 1. Media expertise, 2. Domain expertise, and 3. Type of search. These factors should be taken into account when studying and designing information search systems."

For example, an article about a specific disease often consists of different facets such as symptom, treatment, cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention. Thus, documents may have different relations based on different facets. Powerful search tools have been developed to help users locate lists of individual documents that are most related to specific keywords. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools that reveal the multifaceted relations of documents within or cross the document clusters. In this paper, we present FacetAtlas, a multifaceted visualization technique for visually analyzing rich text corpora. FacetAtlas combines search technology with advanced visual analytical tools to convey both global and local patterns simultaneously. We describe several unique aspects of FacetAtlas, including (1) node cliques and multifaceted edges, (2) an optimized density map, and (3) automated opacity pattern enhancement for highlighting visual patterns, (4) interactive context switch between facets. In addition, we demonstrate the power of FacetAtlas through a case study that targets patient education in the health care domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of this work, especially in support of complex multifaceted data analysis."

Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections. However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection. We present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time Scatter/Gather of arbitrarily large collections after near-linear time preprocessing. This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy. A modification of Scatter/Gather employing this scheme, and an example of its use over the Tipster collection are presented."

To gain an overview of the information space and the retrieved resources, the information seeker has to issue several search queries and skim many search results. In this paper we show how visualization widgets (VisGets) are a viable way to query and visualize multiple types of Web data. We have applied VisGets to three prominent resource types on theWeb—hypertext, syndicated content, and SemanticWeb data—and discuss the limitations of the VisGets prototype and the challenges of this approach."

The main information retrieval mechanisms provided by the prevailing Internet Web software are based on either keyword search (e.g., Google and Yahoo) or hypertext browsing (e.g., Internet Explorer and Netscape). The research presented in this paper is aimed at providing an alternative concept-based categorization and search capability based on a combination of meta-search and self-organizing maps. Kohonen's self-organizing map is very well known as a clustering and dimension reduction tool. Clustering can be used for categorization of search results. Dimension reduction can be used for visualization and for reducing information in order to ease search."

                    "abstract": "Performing exhaustive searches over a large number of text documents can be tedious, since it is very hard to formulate search queries or define filter criteria that capture an analyst's information need adequately. Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops. We see our work as a step towards introducing user controlled classification methods in addition to text search and filtering for increasing recall in analytics scenarios involving large corpora."

Although this list-based representa- tion makes it easy to evaluate a single document, it does not support the users in the broader tasks of manipulating the search results, comparing documents, or finding a set of rel- evant documents. HotMap provides a compact visual rep- resentation of web search results at two levels of detail, and supports the interactive exploration of web search results. User studies have shown that HotMap can result in fewer low-relevance documents being considered, and generates a higher level of confidence, ease of use, and satisfaction than a Google-like interface."

                    "abstract": "Most approaches to image retrieval on the web have their basis in document search techniques. Images are indexed based on the text that is related to the images. Queries are matched to this text to produce a set of search results, which are organized in paged grids that are remi- niscent of lists of documents. Due to ambiguity both with user-supplied queries and with the text used to describe the images within the search index, most image searches contain many irrelevant images distributed throughout the search results, and are often focused on the most common interpretation of the query. We propose a method for addressing these problems in which conceptual query expansion is used to generate a diverse range of images, and a multi-resolution extension of a self-organizing map is used to group visually similar images. The resulting interface acts as an intelligent search assistant, automati- cally diversifying the search results and then allowing the searcher to interactively highlight and filter images based on the concepts, and zoom into an area within the image space to show additional images that are visually similar. Evaluations show that the precision of the image search results increase as a result of concept-based focusing and filtering, as well as visual zooming operations, even for uncommon interpretations of ambiguous queries."

We intro- duce Apolo, a system that uses a mixed-initiative approach combining visualization, rich user interaction and machine learningto guide the user to incrementally and interac- tively explore large network data and make sense of it. Apolo engages the user in bottom-up sensemaking to gradually build up an understanding over time by starting small, rather than starting big and drilling down. Apolo also helps users find relevant information by specifying exemplars, and then us- ing a machine learning method called Belief Propagation to infer which other nodes may be of interest. We evaluated Apolo with twelve participants in a between-subjects study, with the task being to find relevant new papers to update an existing survey paper. Using expert judges, participants using Apolo found significantly more relevant papers. Sub- jective feedback of Apolo was also very positive."

This paper describes the implementation of multiple coordinated views within the Media Watch on Climate Change, a domain-specific news aggregation portal available at www.ecoresearch.net/climate that combines a portfolio of semantic services with a visual information exploration and retrieval interface. The system builds contextualized information spaces by enriching the content repository with geospatial, semantic and temporal annotations, and by applying semi-automated ontology learning to create a controlled vocabulary for structuring the stored information. Portlets visualize the different dimensions of the contextualized information spaces, providing the user with multiple views on the latest news media coverage. Context information facilitates access to complex datasets and helps users navigate large repositories of Web documents. Currently, the system synchronizes information landscapes, domain ontologies, geographic maps, tag clouds and just-in-time information retrieval agents that suggest similar topics and nearby locations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

None leverages the structured data presented in web pages. This paper describes Sifter, a web browser extension that can augment a well-structured web site with advanced filtering and sorting functionality. These added features work inside the site's own pages, preserving the site's presentational style and the user's context. Sifter contains an algorithm that scrapes structured data out of well-structured web pages while usually requiring no user intervention. We tested Sifter on real web sites and real users and found that people could use Sifter to perform sophisticated queries and high-level analyses on sizable data collections on the Web. We propose that web sites can be similarly augmented with other sophisticated data-centric functionality, giving users new benefits over the existing Web."

Authors can produce electronic documents that collaborate and share data, analysis, visualization parameters, information and insight while distributed over the Internet, using intuitive visual navigation techniques. Using multiple coordinated views in a dynamic document will further help the reader to explore complex, multivariate data and discover their relationships. Visual data navigation is provided through interactive 2D and 3D visualisation components based on scalable and customisable, multilayer component architecture with a small footprint suitable for Web distribution. A \"Viewer\" client-side plug-in, responsible for data interactivity and visualization, is distributed as freeware to allow free distribution of dynamic documents over any network."

However, the problems start as soon as mail volumes go beyond the scope of human information processing capabilities. Firstly, time does not allow for leaving certain messages unanswered for a long time, and in certain cases, for reading all messages. Secondly, the dilemma of electronic filters leaves a choice of too many junk mails getting through versus a risk of solicited mails being dumped. In this paper we present a new interactive visual data mining approach for analyzing individual e-mail commu- nication. It combines classical visual analytics (help to identify pattern such as peaks and trends over time) with geo-spatial map distortions (help to understand the routes of e-mails). Experiments show that our visual e-mail explorer produces useful and interesting visualizations of large collections of e-mail and is practical for exploring temporal and geo-spatial patterns hidden in the e-mail data."

These shortcomings may be especially problematic in digital libraries since library searchers employ a wide variety of information seeking methods (with varying degrees of support), and the corpus to be searched is often more complex than simple textual information. This pa- per presents Bow Tie Academic Search, an interactiveWeb- based academic library search interface aimed at supporting the strategic retrieval behaviour of searchers. In this sys- tem, a histogram of the most frequently used keywords in the top search results is provided, along with a compact vi- sual encoding that represents document similarities based on the co-use of keywords. In addition, the list-based repre- sentation of the search results is enhanced with visual repre- sentations of citation information for each search result. A detailed view of this citation information is provided when a particular search result is selected. These tools are de- signed to provide visual and interactive support for query refinement, search results exploration, and citation naviga- tion, making extensive use of the metadata provided by the underlying academic information retrieval system.

PubCloud responds to queries of this database with tag clouds generated from words extracted from the abstracts returned by the query. The results of a user study comparing the PubCloud tag-cloud summarization of query results with the standard result list provided by PubMed indicated that the tag cloud interface is advantageous in presenting descriptive information and in reducing user frustration but that it is less effective at the task of enabling users to discover relations between concepts."

However, scientists still routinely use TF binding site (TFBS) search tools to scan unannotated sequences for TFBSs, particularly when searching for lesser-known TFs or TFs in organisms for which ChIP-seq data are unavailable. The sequence analysis often involves multiple steps such as TF model collection, promoter sequence retrieval, and visualization; thus, several different tools are required. We have developed a novel integrated web tool named LASAGNA-Search that allows users to perform TFBS searches without leaving the web site. LASAGNA-Search uses the LASAGNA (Length-Aware Site Alignment Guided by Nucleotide Association) algorithm for TFBS alignment. Important features of LASAGNA-Search include (i) acceptance of unaligned variable-length TFBSs, (ii) a collection of 1726 TF models, (iii) automatic promoter sequence retrieval, (iv) visualization in the UCSC Genome Browser, and (v) gene regulatory network inference and visualization based on binding specificities. LASAGNA-Search is freely available at http://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/."

We discuss the basis for constructing our evaluation methodology in contrast to previous relevant open evaluations, arguing that the elements which make up an evaluation methodology: the tasks, data and metrics, are interdependent and the way in which they are combined is critical to the effectiveness of the methodology. The paper discusses the relationship between these three factors as implemented in our own work, as well as in {SUMMAC/MUC/DUC.}"

To avoid switching between webpages, we present in this paper an approach to support the handling of data and tasks further added onto the browsed webpages in terms of augmented Web browsing. Without changing the existing Web contents and page-layouts, two levels of visual supports addable onto any existing webpage are suggested: (1) at micro level, visual cues encoding additional information are directly bound to particular hypermedia items, and (2) at macro level, additional visual layers are flexibly attached onto the browsed webpages. To illustrate the ideas, the Firefox add-on VizMe is developed with examples mimicking Google as a browser's extension, and to browse Web snippets with geospatial and temporal references. © 2013 IEEE."

One possibility of improving code search is the utilization of structural information in form of abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, developers usually work with the textual representation of source code and, thus, have difficulties in expressing their queries as fragments of abstract syntax trees and in interpreting the results. This paper addresses assistance of query composition and search result visualization. Query formulation is considered to be an iterative process. After one query is run, the AST vertices neighbored to the result vertices are analyzed to propose refinement options for the next query. Search results are visualized in a tree view which aggregates all matches in a compact way instead of showing a small number of ranked matches."

The reason is that the participating information sources contribute limited content and limited access methods. In prior work, these limited access methods have often been specified using a set of parameterized views, with the understanding that the integration system accepts only queries which have an equivalent rewriting using the views. These queries are called feasible. Infeasible queries are rejected without an explanatory feedback. \\n\\nTo help a developer, who is building an integration application, avoid a frustrating trial-and-error cycle, we introduce the CLIDE query formulation interface, which extends the QBE-like query builder of Microsoft’s SQL Server with a coloring scheme that guides the user toward formulating feasible queries. We provide guarantees that the suggested query edit actions are complete (i.e. each feasible query can be built by following only suggestions), rapidly convergent (the suggestions are tuned to lead to the closest feasible completions of the query) and suitably summarized (at each interaction step, only a minimal number of actions needed to preserve completeness are suggested). We present the algorithms, implementation and performance evaluation showing that CLIDE is a viable on-line tool."

Information visualization can aid the user in many of these search related tasks. Certainly, the user is familiar with browsing and manipulating the search results through textual style interfaces, but they would gain a better understanding of the information through different presentation methods. Thus, we believe rank ordered lists should be used along-side abstract information visualization presentations. We present a system that displays multiple views of search result information. It provides views for displaying abstract visualization designs using multiform glyphs as well as a ranked text based list. Our engine also retrieves detailed information about the located sites (such as size of page, and quantities of internal and external links); and we describe two glyph designs that display this rich information."

The current study focuses on such an evaluation of NIRVE, a tool that supports visualization of search results. Insofar as possible, functionally equivalent 3D, 2D, and text versions of NIRVE were implemented. Nine novices and six professional users completed a series of information-seeking tasks on a set of retrieved documents. There were high interface costs for the 3D visualization, although those costs decreased substantially with experience. Performance was best when the tool’s properties matched task demands; only under the right combination of task, user, and interface did 3D visualization result in performance comparable to functionally matched 2D and textual tools"

However, it is still very challenging to design effective visual metaphors to represent large corpora of text due to the unstructured and high-dimensional nature of text. In this paper, we propose a data model that can be used to represent most of the text corpora. Such a data model contains four basic types of facets: time, category, content (unstructured), and structured facet. To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds. We encode the four types of data facets with four separate visual dimensions. To help people discover evolutionary and correlation patterns, we also develop several visual interaction methods that allow people to interactively analyze text by one or more facets. Finally, we present two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in support of multi-faceted visual analysis of text corpora."

While this works well for the Web, there is opportunity for improvement in the domain of personal information stores, which tend to have more heterogeneous data and richer metadata. In this paper, we introduce FacetMap, an interactive, query-driven visualization, generalizable to a wide range of metadata-rich data stores. FacetMap uses a visual metaphor for both input (selection of metadata facets as filters) and output. Results of a user study provide insight into tradeoffs between FacetMap's graphical approach and the traditional text-oriented approach."

After one or two reformulations the user may implicitly realize patterns and relationships between the multiple search results. We believe that these patterns can be used to identify interesting results. We have developed the prototype Search Engine Similarity (SES) tool which explicitly visualizes the similarity between multiple searches. In this paper we describe an experiment to determine whether explicitly visualizing the relationships between multiple searches will let users browse more effectively. Our results show that explicit difference visualizations can enhance the search process for some tasks."

However, there are indications that the result presentation format is undergoing some evolutionary changes. The discussion will examine primarily the structural aspects of alternative formats to the traditional list format and motivate a program of comparative evaluation. A summary of current structure templates provides a resource for designers of future result visualisations."

Exploratory search opens new possibilities for employing social aspects for effective information retrieval. We facilitate exploratory search by providing users with an integrated search and navigation interface combining three search paradigms - full text search, view-based (faceted) search and content-based (query-by-example) search. Full text search is used for both domain data and metadata lookup, view-based search allows users to further refine/filter the respective result set, while content-based search orders or biases the results based on their similarity to a given set of sample results."

In addition, we discuss the results of several months of public deployment of word trees on Many Eyes, which provides a window onto the ways in which users obtain value from the visualization."

                    "abstract": "This monograph is directed at researchers and developers who are designing the next generation of web search user interfaces, by focusing on the techniques and visualizations that allow users to interact with and have control over their findings. Search is one of the keys to the Webs success. The elegant way in which search results are returned has been well researched and is usually remarkably effective. However, the body of work produced by decades of research into information retrieval continues to grow rapidly and so it has become hard to synthesize the current state-of-the-art to produce a search interface that is both highly functional, but not cluttered and distracting. Further, recent work has shown that there is substantial room for improving the support provided to users who are exhibiting more exploratory forms of search, including when users may need to learn, discover, and understand novel or complex topics. Overall, there is a recognized need for search systems to provide effective user experiences that do more than simply return results. With the aim of producing more effective search interfaces, human computer interaction researchers and web designers have been developing novel interactions and features that enable users to conveniently visualize, parse, manipulate, and organize their Web search results. For instance, while a simple set of results may produce specific information (e.g., the capital of Peru), other methods may let users see and explore the contexts of their requests for information (more about the country, city, and nearby attractions), or the properties that associate groups of information assets (grouping hotels, restaurants, and attractions by their type, district, or price). Other techniques support information-seeking processes that may last weeks or months or may even require collaboration between multiple searchers. The choice of relevant result visualization strategies in new search systems should reflect the searchers and the higher-level information needs that motivate their searches. These examples provide further motivation for supporting designers, who are challenged to synthesize and understand the breadth of advances in search, so that they can determine the benefits of varied strategies and apply them appropriately to build better systems. To support researchers and designers in synthesizing and understanding the advances in search, this monograph offers a structured means to think about web search result visualization, based on an inclusive model of search that integrates information retrieval, information seeking and a higher-level context of tasks and goals. We examine each of these levels of search in a survey of advances in browsers and related tools by defining search-related cognitive processes and analyzing innovative design approaches. We then discuss evaluations at each of these levels of search, presenting significant results and identifying both the traditional and novel means used to produce them. Based on this examination, we propose taxonomy of search result visualization techniques that can be used to identify gaps for future research and as a reference for designers of next generation web search systems."

The abundance of information on WWW cause information overload problem, where users find hard to filter and select information return by the search system. Moreover, the growth of new inexperienced users creates new challenges for information retrieval researchers. It has become increasingly difficult for these users to find relevant documents that satisfying their information need. This problem is due to the fact that this category of user is unable to express his exact need of information which leads to the use of inappropriate keywords or queries. This paper presents a study of the user searching behavior on query formulation. In this paper, query formulation is divided into two categories; breadth and depth query strategies. The findings of this study show that breadth query strategy is the most popular strategy."

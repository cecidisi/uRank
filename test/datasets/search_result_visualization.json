Taking into account information about a user, adaptive visualization attempts to provide user-adapted visual presenta- tion of information. This paper proposes Adaptive VIBE, an approach for adap- tive visualization of search results in an intelligence analysis context. Adaptive VIBE extends the popular VIBE visualization framework by infusing user model terms as reference points for spatial document arrangement and manipula- tion. We explored the value of the proposed approach using data obtained froma user study. The result demonstrated that user modeling and spatial visu- alization technologies are able to reinforce each other, creating an enhanced level of user support. Spatial visualization amplifies the user model's ability to separate relevant and non-relevant documents, whereas user modeling adds valuable reference points to relevance-based spatial visualization.

However, the majority of studies on personalized search focused on a rather simple type of search, which leaves an important research topic – the personalization in exploratory searches – as an under-studied area. In this paper, we present a study of personalization in task- based information exploration using a system called TaskSieve. TaskSieve is a Web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based profile, called a “task model”, for personalization. Its innovations include flexible and user controlled integration of queries and task models, task-infused text snippet generation, and on-screen visualization of task models. Through an empirical study using human subjects conducting task-based exploration searches, we demonstrate that TaskSieve pushes significantly more relevant documents to the top of search result lists as compared to a traditional search system. TaskSieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks, allows the users to do so with higher productivity, and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics."

In particular, we are interested in ways to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems to decide how they might best be constructed. In this study, we construct and evaluate systems that present the user with ranked lists and a visualization of inter-document similarities. We first carry out a user study to evaluate the clustering/ranked list combination on instance-oriented retrieval, the task of the TREC-6 Interactive Track. We find that although users generally prefer the combination, they are not able to use it to improve effectiveness. In the second half of this study, we develop and evaluate an approach that more directly combines the ranked list with information from inter-document similarities. Using the TREC collections and relevance judgments, we show that it is possible to realize substantial improvements in effectiveness by doing so, and that although users can use the combined information effectively, the system can provide hints that substantially improve on the user's solo effort. The resulting approach shares much in common with an interactive application of incremental relevance feedback. Throughout this study, we illustrate our work using two prototype systems constructed for these evaluations. The first, AspInQuery, is a classic information retrieval system augmented with a specialized tool for recording information about instances of relevance. The other system, Lighthouse, is a Web-based application that combines a ranked list with a portrayal of inter-document similarity. Lighthouse can work with collections such as TREC, as well as the results of Web search engines."

This study, within contrasting departments (Humanities, Computing and Business) of a London university, reviews the social and organisational impacts of DLs across these disciplines. In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to gather data from 25 lecturers and librarians, and results analysed using the grounded theory method. Webaccessible DLs are identified as changing the roles and working patterns of academic staff (i.e. lecturers, librarians and computer support staff). However, poor accessibility due to inappropriate implementation strategies, access mechanisms, searching support & DL usability reduces the use of these resources. Consequently, web and personal collections without guarantees of quality are widely used as an accessible alternative. One conclusion is the importance of implementation strategies (e.g. giving feedback on document context, collection boundaries, ownership, accountability and support) in informing DL design."

Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and are visualised as stars, forming clusters with distinct shapes. For greater performance, the hierarchical structure is exploited and force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on much fewer objects, rather than on the whole corpus. Collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised with bounding polygons using a modified weighted Voronoi diagram. Their area is related to the number of documents contained. Textual labels are displayed dynamically during navigation, adjusting to the visualisation content. Navigation is animated and provides a seamless zooming transition between summary and detail view. Users can map metadata such as document size or age to attributes of the visualisation such as colour and luminance. Queries can be made and matching documents or collections are highlighted. Formative usability testing is ongoing; a small baseline experiment comparing the telescope browser to a tree browser is discussed."

This approach has been implemented in a system named VIEWER (VIEwing WEb Results), acting as an inter- face to available search engines. An experimental eval- uation of the performance of VIEWER in contrast to AltaVista is the major focus of the paper. We first re- port the results of an experiment on single, short query searches where VIEWER, used as an interactive rank- ing system, markedly outperformed AltaVista. We then concentrate on a more realistic searching scenario, in- volving free query formulation, unconstrained selection of retrieval results, and possibility of query reformulation. We report the results of an experiment where the use of VIEWER, compared to AltaVista, seemed to shift the user effort from inspection to evaluation of results, in- creasing retrieval effectiveness, and user satisfaction. In particular, we found that the VIEWER users retrieved half as many nonrelevant documents as the AltaVista users while retrieving a comparable number of relevant documents."

These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text."

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm."

Our system, FeatureLens1, visualizes a text collection at several levels of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns. The current implementation focuses on frequent itemsets of n-grams, as they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection. Users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing them within and across documents in the collection. This also permits users to identify the temporal evolution of usage such as increasing, decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns. The interface could be used to explore other text features as well. Initial studies suggest that FeatureLens helped a literary scholar and 8 users generate new hypotheses and interesting insights using 2 text collections. Categories"

Each textual snippet shows a content summary of the referred document (or webpage) and a link to it. This display has many advantages, for example, it affords easy navigation and is straightforward to interpret. Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query--for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed--the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a \"bag-of-words\" vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown."

As a consequence, many underlying assumptions must be altered for retrieval from full-length text collections. This paper argues for making use of text structure when retrieving from full text documents, and presents a visualization paradigm, called TileBars, that demonstrates the usefulness of explicit term distribution information in Boolean-type queries. TileBars simultaneously and compactly indicate relative document length, query term frequency, and query term distribution. The patterns in a column of TileBars can be quickly scanned and deciphered, aiding users in making judgments about the potential relevance of the retrieved documents."

Even when they provide a good query, users often find it challenging to evaluate the results of their web searches. Sources of these problems include the lack of support for query refine- ment, and the static nature of the list-based representations of web search results. To address these issues, we have developed WordBars, an interactive tool for web informa- tion retrieval. WordBars visually represents the frequencies of the terms found in the first 100 document surrogates re- turned from the initial query. This system allows the users to interactively re-sort the search results based on the fre- quencies of the selected terms within the document surro- gates, as well as to add and remove terms from the query, generating a new set of search results. Examples illustrate how WordBars can provide valuable support for query re- finement and search results exploration, both when specific and vague initial queries are provided."

An eval- uation of the search results for a set of vague queries has shown that the re-sorted search results can provide a higher portion of relevant documents among the top search results. User studies show an increase in speed and effectiveness and a reduction in missed documents when comparing HotMap to the list-based representa- tion used by Google.

In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (“tiles”). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of useful- ness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 partic- ipants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, As- pecTiles affects the user’s information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multi- aspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found Aspec- Tiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search per- formance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified. ∗This"

Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations on metrics and techniques for evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis."

Our new visualizations are based on our experi- ences developing a visual information retrieval system called INSYDER to supply small and medium size enter- prises with business information from the Internet. Based on extensive user tests the original visualizations have been redesigned in two different design variants. Instead of offering multiple visualizations to choose from the Su- perTable + Scatterplot combines them in a new way. Therefore, the user has the feeling that he is working with one single visualization in different states. Further the SuperTable solves a problem which seemed to be imma- nent to visualizations in document retrieval: the change of modalities."

By developing a parallel implementation of the text processing engine, we enabled visual analytics tools to exploit cluster architectures and handle massive datasets. The paper describes key elements of our parallelization approach and demonstrates virtually linear scaling when processing multi-gigabyte data sets such as Pubmed. This approach enables interactive analysis of large datasets beyond capabilities of existing state-of-the art visual analytics tools."

Location, color, movement, and spatial distance of objects in the visual space are used to represent the semantic relationships between a query and relevant Web pages. Especially, the movement of objects and their speeds add a new dimension to the visual space, illustrating the degree of relevance among a query and Web search results in the context of users' subjects of interest. By interacting with the visual space, users are able to observe the semantic relevance between a query and a resulting Web page with respect to their subjects of interest, context information, or concern. Users' subjects of interest can be dynamically changed, redefined, added, or deleted from the visual space."

The visual- ization uses a focus+context (fisheye) technique that works effectively on tabular information because it allows display of crucial label information and multiple distal focal areas. In addition, a graphical mapping scheme for depicting table contents has been developed for the most widespread kind of tables, the cases-by-variables table. The Table Lens fuses symbolic and graphical representations into a single coherent view that can be fluidly adjusted by the user.

INSYDER addresses these possibilities and offers power- ful retrieval and visualisation functionalities. The main focus during the development was on the usability of the system. Therefore, a variety of well-established visual- isation components were employed to support the user during the information-seeking process (e.g. visual query, result table, bar graph, segment view with tile bars, and scatterplot). Also, the retrieval aspects were developed with the goal of increasing the usability of the system(e.g. natural language search, content-based classification, rel- evance feedback). Extensive evaluations of the retrieval performance and the usability of the visualisation were conducted. The results of these evaluations offered many helpful insights into developing a new visual-information- seeking system called VisMeB. Keywords:"

Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes in- creasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose FacetScape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the FacetScape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space."

The popular search engines do not, how- ever, present the relevance scores that were computed during this process. We suggest that these relevance scores may contain infor- mation that can help users make conscious decisions. In this paper we evaluate in a user study how users react to the display of such scores. The results indicate that users understand graphical dis- plays of relevance, and make decisions based on these scores. Our results suggest that in the context of exploratory search, relevance scores may cause users to explore more search results."

It describes MetaCrystal and its linked tools that enable users to control how to combine and filter the search results by different search engines. A hierarchy of aggregation is employed to provide users with quick insights into the number of documents found by a specific number or combination of search engines. MetaCrystal enables users to visually perform advanced filtering operations, such as complex Boolean constraints. This paper also discusses how to support tight coupling between the filtering controls and tools that operate at different levels of aggregation. 1."

As the number of documents and the corre- sponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine them more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents."

Many such searches are executed against PubMed, a central repository of life sciences articles, and often re- turn hundreds, or even thousands, of results, pointing to the need for data exploration tools. In this demonstration we present Sky- lineSearch, a semantic ranking and result visualization system de- signed specifically for PubMed, and available to the scientific com- munity at skyline.cs.columbia.edu. Our system lever- ages semantic annotations of articles with terms from the MeSH controlled vocabulary, and presents results as a two-dimensional skyline, plotting relevance against publication date. We demon- strate that SkylineSearch supports a richer data exploration experi- ence than does the search functionality of PubMed, allowing users to find relevant references more easily. We also show that Skyline- Search executes queries and presents results in interactive time."

We present an alternative based on enabling users to navigate along conceptual dimensions that describe the images. The interface makes use of hierarchical faceted metadata and dynamically generated query previews. A usability study, in which 32 art history students explored a collection of 35,000 fine arts images, compares this approach to a standard image search interface. Despite the unfamiliarity and power of the interface (attributes that often lead to rejection of new search interfaces), the study results show that 90% of the participants preferred the metadata approach overall, 97% said that it helped them learn more about the collection, 75% found it more flexible, and 72% found it easier to use than a standard baseline system. These results indicate that a category-based approach is a successful way to provide access to image collections."

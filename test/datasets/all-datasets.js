The task of top-N item recommendation is to predict a ranking of items (movies, books, songs, or products in general) that can be of interest for a user based on earlier preferences of the user. We focus on implicit feedback where preferences are given in the form of binary events/ratings. Differently from state-of-the-art methods, the method proposed is designed to optimize the AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. Specifically, this turns out in a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods in terms of AUC of the obtained predictions.","uri":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84908891039&partnerID=tZOtx3y1","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-63636939","title":"Clustering-based diversity improvement in top-N recommendation","creator":"Aytekin, Tevfik; Karakaya, Mahmut Özge","description":"The major aim of recommender algorithms has been to predict accurately the rating value of items. However, it has been recognized that accurate prediction of rating values is not the only requirement for achieving user satisfaction. One other requirement, which has gained importance recently, is the diversity of recommendation lists. Being able to recommend a diverse set of items is important for user satisfaction since it gives the user a richer set of items to choose from and increases the chance of discovering new items. In this study, we propose a novel method which can be used to give each user an option to adjust the diversity levels of their own recommendation lists. Experiments show that the method effectively increases the diversity levels of recommendation lists with little decrease in accuracy. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed method, while achieving similar diversification performance, has a very low computational time complexity, which makes it highly scalable and allows it to be used in the online phase of the recommendation process. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-49414843","title":"Matrix factorization techniques for context aware recommendation","creator":"Baltrunas, Linas; Ludwig, Bernd; Ricci, Francesco","description":"Context aware recommender systems (CARS) adapt the recommendations to the specific situation in which the items will be consumed.

While collaborative filtering systems often result in better predictive performance, content-based filtering offers solutions to the limitations of collaborative filtering, as well as a natural way to interact with users.

The enormous growth of learning objects on the internet and the availability of preferences of usage by the community of users in the existing learning object repositories (LORs) have opened the possibility of testing the efficiency of CF algorithms on recommending learning materials to the users of these communities. In this paper we evaluated recommendations of learning resources generated by different well known memory-based CF algorithms using two databases (with implicit and explicit ratings) gathered from the popular MERLOT repository. We have also contrasted the results of the generated recommendations with several existing endorsement mechanisms of the repository to explore possible relations among them. Finally, the recommendations generated by the different algorithms were compared in order to evaluate whether or not they were overlapping. The results found here can be used as a starting point for future studies that account for the specific context of learning object repositories and the different aspects of preference in learning resource selection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding running routes, getting from A to B is less important than running on a route which meets specific requirements relevant to a runner. Map data is usually obtained for car routing problems. Data on running routes, particularly routes which are in remote areas, might only consist of GPS traces with no additional information such as terrain or lighting. In order to tackle these issues, running routes are considered as objects described with different attributes. As a result, recommendation of running routes becomes a multi-criteria decision making problem. We describe how this objects and their attributes can be obtained. We incorporate personalization by applying a location-based filtering mechanism to determine running routes in the vicinity of a user or a user-specified location. This selection is then sorted by an ontology supported ranking mechanism which evaluates route attributes in relation to a user profile, user context and collaborative features.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2012"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-26189694","title":"Context-aware collaborative filtering system: predicting the user's preferences in ubiquitous computing","creator":"Chen, Annie","description":"In this paper I propose a context-aware collaborative filtering system that can predict a user's preference in different context situations based on past user-experiences.

Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can ``intelligently'' determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions. The common solution, ``explicit ratings'', where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise. However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more ``intelligent'' method is to useimplicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user. These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating. Current recommender systems mostly do not use implicit ratings, nor is the ability of implicit ratings to predict actual user interest well-understood. This research studies the correlation between various implicit ratings and the explicit rating for a single Web page. A Web browser was developed to record the user's actions (implicit ratings) and the explicit rating of a page. Actions included mouse clicks, mouse movement, scrolling and elapsed time. This browser was used by over 80 people that browsed more than 2500 Web pages. Using the data collected by the browser, the individual implicit ratings and some combinations of implicit ratings were analyzed and compared with the explicit rating. We found that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling had a strong correlation with explicit interest, while individual scrolling methods and mouse-clicks were ineffective in predicting explicit interest.","uri":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/359784.359836\\nhttp://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=359836&type=pdf\\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359836\\nhttp://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=359784.359836","facets":{"year":"2001"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-17058893","title":"Performance of recommender algorithms on top-n recommendation tasks","creator":"Cremonesi, Paolo; Koren, Yehuda; Turrin, Roberto","description":"In many commercial systems, the ‘best bet’ recommenda- tions are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top- N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recom- mender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accu- racy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non- personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, re- gardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other rec- ommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommenda- tion task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.","uri":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1864708.1864721","facets":{"year":"2010"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-13993628","title":"An evaluation methodology for collaborative recommender systems","creator":"Cremonesi, Paolo; Turrin, Roberto; Lentini, Eugenio; Matteucci, Matteo","description":"Recommender systems use statistical and knowledge discovery techniques in order to recommend products to users and to mitigate the problem of information overload.

In these types of applications, data to be clustered is in the form of user sessions which are sequences of web pages visited by the user. Sequence clustering is one of the important tools to work with this type of data. One way to represent sequence data is through weighted, undirected graphs where each sequence is a vertex and the pairwise similarities between the user sessions are the edges. Through this representation, the problem becomes equivalent to graph partitioning which is NP-complete and is best approached using multiple objectives. Hence it is suitable to use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) to solve it. The main focus of this paper is to determine an effective MOEA to cluster sequence data. Several existing approaches in literature are compared on sample data sets and the most suitable approach is determined.

We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems.

A complicated knowledge network of individuals, documents, data, concepts, and their interconnections forms a virtual knowledge repository. To be more effective in using these resources, knowledge discovery tools are crucial for an organization and individual users to identify the right expertise or knowledge resources from this large \"multidimensional network.\"  Cyberinfrastructure Knowledge Networks on the Web (CIKNOW) is a suite of Web-based tools that facilitates discovery of resources within communities. CI-KNOW implements a network recommendation system that incorporates social motivations for why we create, maintain, and dissolve our knowledge network ties. The network data is captured by automated harvesting of digital resources using Web crawlers, text miners, tagging tools that automatically generate community-oriented metadata, and scientometric data such as co-authorship and citations. Based on this knowledge network, the CI-KNOW recommender system produces personalized search results through two steps: identify matching entities according to their metadata and network statistics and select the best fits according to requester's perspectives and connections in social networks.  Integrated with community Web portals, CI-KNOW navigation and auditing portlets provide analysis and visualization tools for community members and serves as a research testbed to examine social theories on individuals' motivations for seeking expertise from specific resources (people, documents, datasets, and etc.).

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2008"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-75909261","title":"Improving Controllability and Predictability of Interactive Recommendation Interfaces for Exploratory Search","creator":"Kangasrääsiö, Antti; Głowacka, Dorota; Kaski, Samuel","description":"In exploratory search, when a user directs a search engine us- ing uncertain relevance feedback, usability problems regard- ing controllability and predictability may arise. One problem is that the user is often modelled as a passive source of rele- vance information, instead of an active entity trying to steer the system based on evolving information needs. This may cause the user to feel that the response of the system is in- consistent with her steering. Another problem arises due to the sheer size and complexity of the information space, and hence of the system, as it may be difficult for the user to an- ticipate the consequences of her actions in this complex en- vironment. These problems can be mitigated by interpreting the user’s actions as setting a goal for an optimization prob- lem regarding the system state, instead of passive relevance feedback, and by allowing the user to see the predicted ef- fects of an action before committing to it.

The fast growth and excellent prospects of the mobile-Web content market have attracted many content providers. However, as continuing deregulation further lowers the entry barriers for providers, increased competition is quickly eliminating profit opportuni- ties. To survive in this environment, providers must offer an intelligent system that provides customers with a more pleasant mobile-shopping experience. A particularly popular form of mobile-Web con- tent is wallpaper images for cell phones.1 Although the market for this content is growing rapidly as related technologies evolve, customers experience much frus- tration when searching for the images they want, owing to inefficient sequential search (see Figure 1). When a customer logs on to an image-download site using a cell phone, the site presents the customer with a list of the best-selling or newest images. The cus- tomer pages through the list and selects an image to inspect. If the customer likes the image, he or she might buy it. Otherwise, the customer repeats these steps until he or she stumbles over the right image or gives up. With this method, the expected number of images the customer views before hitting the desired image far exceeds the acceptable level. These difficulties are partly attributable to the cell phone’s characteristics. Compared to PCs, cell phones have smaller screens, fewer input keys, and less sophisticated browsers. So, the user interface of mobile-Web applications isn’t as friendly as that of typical Web applications. Consequently, many cus- tomers use their PCs to select images and then request a download to their mobile devices. Nevertheless, searching generally remains inconvenient and com- plex. To make searching more acceptable, a more efficient search aid that suggests only the images meet- ing the customer’s preference is necessary. As a solution to these problems, we propose VIS- CORS (Visual Contents Recommender System). To reduce customers’search effort,VISCORS combines the two most popular information-filtering techniques: collaborative filtering and content-based image retrieval. Combined, these techniques properly han- dle the distinct characteristics of visual content while taking into account the mobile Web’s constraints","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2004"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-96281280","title":"Effective Context-aware Recommendation on the Semantic Web","creator":"Kim, Sungrim; Kwon, Joonhee","description":"Semantic web is the driving technology of today's Internet as it can provide valuable information on-the-fly to users everywhere.

Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2012"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-24523314","title":"Recommender systems: From algorithms to user experience","creator":"Konstan, Joseph a.; Riedl, John","description":"Since their introduction in the early 1990’s, automated recommender systems have revolutionized the marketing and delivery of commerce and content by providing personalized recommendations and predictions over a variety of large and complex product offerings.

It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2010"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-18392429","title":"PeerChooser: Visual Interactive Recommendation","creator":"O'Donovan, John; Smyth, Barry; Gretarsson, Brynjar; Bostandjiev, Svetlin; Höllerer, Tobias","description":"Collaborative filtering (CF) has been successfully deployed over the years to compute predictions on items based on a user's correlation with a set of peers. The black-box nature of most CF applications leave the user wondering how the system arrived at its recommendation. This note introduces PeerChooser, a collaborative recommender system with an interactive graphical explanation interface. Users are provided with a visual explanation of the CF process and opportunity to manipulate their neighborhood at varying levels of granularity to reflect aspects of their current requirements. In this manner we overcome the problem of redundant profile information in CF systems, in addition to providing an explanation interface. Our layout algorithm produces an exact, noiseless graph representation of the underlying correlations between users. PeerChooser's prediction component uses this graph directly to yield the same results as the benchmark. User's then improve on these predictions by tweaking the graph to their current requirements. We present a user-survey in which PeerChooser compares favorably against a benchmark CF algorithm.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2008"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-93171237","title":"Using Hierarchical Graph Maps to Explain Collaborative Filtering Recommendations","creator":"Ortega, Fernando; Bobadilla, Jesus; Hernando, Antonio; Rodriguez, Fernando","description":"The explanation of and justification for recommendation results are important objectives in recommender systems because such explanations and justifications strongly influence the user's trust in the system.

In this paper, we present a method that generates tree graphs that contain the following information: the recommended items, the items that have appeared most often in the recommendation process, the relative importance of the items, and the relationships that exist among the items. The trees obtained in the experiments show (1) the greater novelty of user-to-user results, (2) the overspecialization inherent in the item-to-item approach, and (3) the equilibrium obtained by employing hybrid user-to-user/item-to-item collaborative filtering.

Seeking for information is however not easy. A proactive recommendation system (PRS) retrieves information relevant to the written text, and presents it without user intervention. The information presented can improve the quality of the text but can also interrupt the process of writing. We describe two experiments performed to optimize the design of the PRS A Propos. Our goal is to develop a PRS for professional writers that present information non-intrusively and timely so as to minimize disturbing the writing process. The results of our experiments suggest that the tendency to interleave (re)search and writing implies a need for integrating the PRS in a writing environment able to support the task of writing the text itself and the stage of planning the contents and structure of the document. Relevance to industry: While automation has increased the efficiency of repetitive processes, the impact on professional tasks has been minor. Professional writing is a complex task that takes a lot of time. The PRS that we are developing can result in substantial reductions of the cost of writing documents, and in substantial improvements of the quality of the written texts.

These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre- existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions.","uri":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=502737","facets":{"year":"2002"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-2725754","title":"Semantic Computing of Moods Based on Tags in Social Media of Music","creator":"Saari, Pasi; Eerola, Tuomas","description":"Social tags inherent in online music services such as Last.fm provide a rich source of information on musical moods. The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.","uri":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1817","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-24379085","title":"Recommender Systems in E-Commerce","creator":"Schafer, J Ben; Konstan, Joseph; Riedi, John","description":"Recommender systems are changing from novelties used by a few E-commerce sites, to serious business tools that are re-shaping the world of E-commerce.

The proposed approach attempts to improve the quality of recommendations through the application of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for ARM in the framework of CF. Consequently, by considering support and confidence measures as different objectives, the MOPSO based ARM model extracts only useful and eminent direct association rules which are optimal in the wider sense that no other rules are superior to them when both objectives are simultaneously considered. In addition, computational efficiency is enhanced by mining rules only for the given user and over the related transactional database. Further, the present work explores the indirect (transitive) association between users as well as between items for providing more accurate recommendations even with highly sparse history of transactions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an experimental study using the MovieLens data set. Experimental results clearly reveal that the proposed method consistently outperform other traditional CF based methods as measured by recommendation accuracy, precision, and recall. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.","uri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2013.07.001","facets":{"year":"2013"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-49314392","title":"Improving collaborative filtering recommendations using external data","creator":"Umyarov, A; Tuzhilin, A","description":"This paper describes an approach for incorporating externally specified aggregate ratings information into certain types of collaborative filtering (CF) methods. For a statistical model-based CF approach, we formally showed that this additional aggregated information provides more accurate recommendations of individual items to individual users.

Both the model-based and the heuristic item-based CF methods were empirically tested on several datasets, and the experiments uniformly confirmed that the aggregate rating information indeed improves CF recommendations. These results also show the power of theory by demonstrating how the insights gained from theoretical developments can shed light on proper selection of good heuristic methods.

In this paper, we present our research on the use of information visualization techniques to interact with recommender systems. We investigated how information visualization can improve user understanding of the typically black-box rationale behind recommendations in order to increase their perceived relevance and meaning and to support exploration and user involvement in the recommendation process.

That is, to recommend products that the end-user likes, but that are not generally popular. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose two strategies to identify relevant but niche products. The first strategy computes an inverse item popularity and applies it during the steps of top-N recommendation. Given a prior probability distribution of relevance based on item popularity, and a user-specific relevance probability, the other strategy uses a number of scores based on distance measures between these two distributions. We emphasize that the problem is to recommend relevant items from the users broader range of tastes. Hence, in evaluation a concentration index is calculated to measure the extent to which the recommendation is spread to the users niche tastes in conjunction with the standard precision metric which measures the overall relevance of the recommended set. The methods are evaluated empirically using the Movielens dataset and show a strong performance in niche item retrieval at the cost of a small reduction in precision.","uri":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5616197","facets":{"year":"2010"}},{"id":"doc-DS_RS-99190280","title":"Random walk models for top-N recommendation task","creator":"Zhang, Y; Wu, J Q; Zhuang, Y T","description":"Recently there has been an increasing interest in applying random walk based methods to recommender systems.

As information explosion, it is necessary to recommend resources that a user might like. Since collaborative filtering (CF) is aimed to provide personalized services, how to integrate tag and time information in CF to provide better personalized recommendations for social tagging systems becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate the importance and usefulness of tag and time information when predicting users' preference and examine how to exploit such information to build an effective resource-recommendation model.

Methods Based on a meta-design approach, we designed and implemented a platform that allows end users, not necessarily experts of technologies, to extract contents from heterogeneous sources and compose Personal Information Spaces (PISs) that satisfy their information needs. Specific emphasis is posed on the adoption of a composition paradigm that abstracts from technical details and can thus be used by non-technical users. Results The platform for service composition that supports the activity of the different involved stakeholders is described in details. Thanks to the separation of concerns on which the composition paradigm is based, the overall approach and its enabling platform are also amenable to customization with respect to the requirements of specific domains. Conclusion We present an approach where a composition platform enables the extraction of content from heterogeneous services and its integration into situational applications where content presentation is flexibly managed through different visual templates.

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation.

This research aimed to determine how meaningful information may be extracted from limited sensor data and transformed to provide clear visualization for the clinicians who must use and interact with the data and make judgments on the condition of patients. We ascertained that a number of insightful features related to habits and physical condition could be determined from usage and motion sensor data. Methods: Our approach to the design of the visualization follows User Centered Design, specifically, defining requirements, designing corresponding visualizations and finally evaluating results. This cycle was iterated three times. Results: The User Centered Design method was successfully employed to converge to a design that met the main objective of this study. The resulting visualizations of relevant features that were extracted from the sensor data were considered highly effective and intuitive to the clinicians and were considered suitable for monitoring the behavior patterns of patients. Conclusions: We observed important differences in the approach and attitude of the researchers and clinicians. Whereas the researchers would prefer to have as many features and information as possible in each visualization, the clinicians would prefer clarity and simplicity, often each visualization having only a single feature, with several visualizations per page. In addition, concepts considered intuitive to the researchers were not always to the clinicians.

Our system, FeatureLens1, visualizes a text collection at several levels of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns. The current implementation focuses on frequent itemsets of n-grams, as they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection. Users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing them within and across documents in the collection. This also permits users to identify the temporal evolution of usage such as increasing, decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns. The interface could be used to explore other text features as well. Initial studies suggest that FeatureLens helped a literary scholar and 8 users generate new hypotheses and interesting insights using 2 text collections.

A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2008"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-91700997","title":"Visualizing temporal patterns in large multivariate data using textual pattern matching","creator":"Glatter, M.a; Huang, J.a; Ahern, S.b; Daniel, J.b; Lu, A.c","description":"Extracting and visualizing temporal patterns in large scientific data is an open problem in visualization research.

This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp--a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time.","uri":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4198697&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","facets":{"year":"2013"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-28490708","title":"Feature-Driven Visual Analytics of Soccer Data","creator":"Halldór, Janetzko; Sache, Dominik; Stein, Manuel; Schreck, Tobias; Keim, Daniel A.; Deussen, Oliver","description":"Soccer is one the most popular sports today and also very interesting from an scientific point of view.

However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation.

In this paper, I propose a pattern of integrating of computational and visual analytics techniques, called just-in-time (JIT) interactive analytics. JIT analytics is performed in real-time on data that users are interacting with to guide visual-analytic exploration. Fundamental to JIT analytics is enriching visualizations with annotations that describe semantics of visual features, thereby suggesting to users possible insights to examine further. To accomplish this, JIT analytics needs to 1) identify insights depicted as visual patterns such as clusters, outliers, and trends in visualizations and 2) determine the semantics of such features by considering not only attributes that are being visualized but also other attributes in data. In this paper, I describe the JIT interactive analytics pattern, along with a generic implementation for any type of visualization and data, and provide a particular implementation for point-based visualization of multivariate data. I argue that the pattern provides a useful user experience by elevating the cognitive level of interaction with data from pure perception of visual representations to understanding higher level semantics of data. As such, this supports users in building faster qualitative mental models and accelerating discovery. Furthermore, facilitating insight opens new research opportunities such as visual-analytic action recommendations, improved collaboration, and accessibility.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2015"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-21173111","title":"Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis: Deriving design principles from a case study","creator":"Kang, Youn-ah; Gorg, C.; Stasko, J.","description":"Despite the growing number of systems providing visual analytic support for investigative analysis, few empirical studies of the potential benefits of such systems have been conducted, particularly controlled, comparative evaluations.

However, clinical adoption of CBIR is partially hindered by the difference between the computed image similarity and the user's search intent, the semantic gap, with the end result that relevant images with outlier features may not be retrieved. Furthermore, most CBIR algorithms do not provide intuitive explanations as to why the retrieved images were considered similar to the query (e.g., which subset of features were similar), hence it is difficult for users to verify if relevant images, with a small subset of outlier features, were missed. Users therefore resort to examining irrelevant images and there are limited opportunities to discover these 'missed' images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to medical CBIR by enabling a guided visual exploration of the search space through a tool, called Visual Analytics for Medical Image Retrieval (VAMIR). The visual analytics approach facilitates interactive exploration of the entire dataset using the query image as a point-of-reference. We conducted a user study and several case studies to demonstrate the capabilities of VAMIR in the retrieval of CT images and multi-modality PET-CT images.","uri":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296409","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-78489940","title":"A visual data mining tool to support cooperative learning","creator":"Le Roux, J.

Typical sources of such data are experiments in biology, physics or engineering, which are conducted in different configurations and use replicates to ensure statistically significant results. One common way to analyze this data is to filter it using statistical methods and then run clustering algorithms to group similar values. The clustering results can be visualized using heat maps, which show differences between groups as changes in color. However, in cases where groups of dimensions have an a priori meaning, it is not desirable to cluster all dimensions combined, since a clustering algorithm can fragment continuous blocks of records. Furthermore, identifying relevant elements in heat maps becomes more difficult as the number of dimensions increases. To aid in such situations, we have developed Matchmaker, a visualization technique that allows researchers to arbitrarily arrange and compare multiple groups of dimensions at the same time. We create separate groups of dimensions which can be clustered individually, and place them in an arrangement of heat maps reminiscent of parallel coordinates. To identify relations, we render bundled curves and ribbons between related records in different groups. We then allow interactive drill-downs using enlarged detail views of the data, which enable in-depth comparisons of clusters between groups. To reduce visual clutter, we minimize crossings between the views. This paper concludes with two case studies. The first demonstrates the value of our technique for the comparison of clustering algorithms. In the second, biologists use our system to investigate why certain strains of mice develop liver disease while others remain healthy, informally showing the efficacy of our system when analyzing multidimensional data containing distinct groups of dimensions.","uri":"http://caleydo.github.io/publications/2010_infovis_matchmaker/","facets":{"year":"2010"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-34269469","title":"StratomeX: Visual Analysis of Large-Scale Heterogeneous Genomics Data for Cancer Subtype Characterization","creator":"Lex, a.; Streit, M.; Schulz, H.-J.; Partl, C.; Schmalstieg, D.; Park, P.J.; Gehlenborg, N.","description":"Identification and characterization of cancer subtypes are important areas of research that are based on the integrated analysis of multiple heterogeneous genomics datasets. Since there are no tools supporting this process, much of this work is done using ad-hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefficient and limits visual exploration of the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill-down features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the configuration of viewing parameters in such a multi-dataset, multi-view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and configuration interface for dataset dependencies and data-view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain experts. We describe case studies that illustrate how investigators used the tool to explore subtypes in large datasets and demonstrate how they efficiently replicated findings from the literature and gained new insights into the data.","uri":["http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03110.x\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKDbGqHsdE","http://caleydo.github.io/publications/2012_eurovis_stratomex/"],"facets":{"year":"2012"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-87319968","title":"VisBricks: Multiform visualization of large, inhomogeneous data","creator":"Lex, Alexander; Schulz, Hans Jörg; Streit, Marc; Partl, Christian; Schmalstieg, Dieter","description":"Large volumes of real-world data often exhibit inhomogeneities: vertically in the form of correlated or independent dimensions and horizontally in the form of clustered or scattered data items.

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple in- stances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effectiveway. To achieve this we employ two differ- ent multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to per- form three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions.

To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time.

Current techniques are either well suited to visualize large amounts of pathway node attributes, or to represent the topology of the pathway well, but do not accomplish both at the same time. To address this we introduce {enRoute}, a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the nodes of this extracted path right next to it. This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially heterogeneous data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of topology and node attributes. As this approach does not modify the layout of pathway maps, it is compatible with arbitrary graph layouts, including those of hand-crafted, image-based pathway maps.

Also, the retrieval aspects were developed with the goal of increasing the usability of the system(e.g. natural language search, content-based classification, rel- evance feedback). Extensive evaluations of the retrieval performance and the usability of the visualisation were conducted. The results of these evaluations offered many helpful insights into developing a new visual-information- seeking system called VisMeB.

For very large time series data with thousands of items, how to visually present ranking changes is an interesting challenge. In this paper, we propose RankExplorer, a novel visualization method based on ThemeRiver to reveal the ranking changes.

Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed.

Clustered heatmaps are the standard technique for visualizing one-way and two-way clustering results. In clustered heatmaps, rows and/or columns are reordered, resulting in a representation that shows the clusters as contiguous blocks. However, for biclustering results, where clusters can overlap, it is not possible to reorder the matrix in this way without duplicating rows and/or columns.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present Furby, an interactive visualization technique for analyzing biclustering results. Our contribution is twofold. First, the technique provides an overview of a biclustering result, showing the actual data that forms the individual clusters together with the information which rows and columns they share. Second, for fuzzy clustering results, the proposed technique additionally enables analysts to interactively set the thresholds that transform the fuzzy (soft) clustering into hard clusters that can then be investigated using heatmaps or bar charts. Changes in the membership value thresholds are immediately reflected in the visualization. We demonstrate the value of Furby by loading biclustering results applied to a multi-tissue dataset into the visualization.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed tool allows analysts to assess the overall quality of a biclustering result. Based on this high-level overview, analysts can then interactively explore the individual biclusters in detail. This novel way of handling fuzzy clustering results also supports analysts in finding the optimal thresholds that lead to the best clusters.","uri":"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/S6/S4","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-359014","title":"Model-driven design for the visual analysis of heterogeneous data.","creator":"Streit, Marc; Schulz, Hans-Jörg; Lex, Alexander; Schmalstieg, Dieter; Schumann, Heidrun","description":"As heterogeneous data from different sources are being increasingly linked, it becomes difficult for users to understand how the data are connected, to identify what means are suitable to analyze a given data set, or to find out how to proceed for a given analysis task. We target this challenge with a new model-driven design process that effectively codesigns aspects of data, view, analytics, and tasks. We achieve this by using the workflow of the analysis task as a trajectory through data, interactive views, and analytical processes. The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool.

When zoomed to fit a computer screen, the detailed structure and node labels of even a moderately-sized network (say, with 500 nodes) can become invisible or difficult to read. Still, the coarse network structure typically remains visible, and helps orient an analyst's zooming, scrolling, and panning operations. These operations are very useful when studying details and reading node labels, but in the process of zooming in on one network region, an analyst may lose track of details elsewhere. To address such problems, we present in this paper multi-focus and multi-window techniques that improve interactive exploration of networks. Based on an analyst's selection of focus nodes, our techniques partition and selectively zoom in on network details, including node labels, close to the focus nodes. Detailed data associated with the zoomed-in nodes can thus be more easily accessed and inspected. The approach enables a user to simultaneously focus on and analyze multiple node neighborhoods while keeping the full network structure in view. We demonstrate our technique by showing how it supports interactive debugging of a Bayesian network model of an electrical power system. In addition, we show that it can simplify visual analysis of an electrical power network as well as a medical Bayesian network. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T.","uri":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1568726","facets":{"year":"2013"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-79653570","title":"Discovery of Temporal Dependencies between Frequent Patterns in Multivariate Time Series","creator":"Tatavarty, Giridhar; Bhatnagar, Raj; Young, Barrington","description":"We consider the problem of mining multivariate time series data for discovering (i) frequently occurring substring patterns in a dimension, (ii) temporal associations among these substring patterns within or across different dimensions, and (iii) large intervals that sustain a particular mode of operation.

The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2007"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-88218997","title":"KronoMiner : Using Multi-Foci Navigation for the Visual Exploration of Time-Series Data","creator":"Zhao, Jian","description":"The need for pattern discovery in long time-series data led researchers to develop interactive visualization tools and analytical algorithms for gaining insight into the data.

The exploration of this data is challenging not only because of large data scales but also the complexity of resource structures and semantics. In this paper, we present PivotSlice, an interactive visualization technique which provides efficient faceted browsing as well as flexible capabilities to discover data relationships. With the metaphor of direct manipulation, PivotSlice allows the user to visually and logically construct a series of dynamic queries over the data, based on a multi-focus and multi-scale tabular view that subdivides the entire dataset into several meaningful parts with customized semantics. PivotSlice further facilitates the visual exploration and sensemaking process through features including live search and integration of online data, graphical interaction histories and smoothly animated visual state transitions. We evaluated PivotSlice through a qualitative lab study with university researchers and report the findings from our observations and interviews. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PivotSlice using a scenario of exploring a repository of information visualization literature.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2013"}},{"id":"doc-DS_VA-93023308","title":"TimeSlice: interactive faceted browsing of timeline data","creator":"Zhao, Jian; Drucker, Steven M; Fisher, Danyel; Brinkman, Donald","description":"Temporal events with multiple sets of metadata attributes, i. e., facets, are ubiquitous across different domains.

In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector.

TaskSieve is a Web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based profile, called a “task model”, for personalization. Its innovations include flexible and user controlled integration of queries and task models, task-infused text snippet generation, and on-screen visualization of task models. Through an empirical study using human subjects conducting task-based exploration searches, we demonstrate that TaskSieve pushes significantly more relevant documents to the top of search result lists as compared to a traditional search system. TaskSieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks, allows the users to do so with higher productivity, and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics.","uri":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1367497.1367499","facets":{"year":"2008"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-59877117","title":"Evaluating combinations of ranked lists and visualizations of inter-document similarity","creator":"Allan, James; Leuski, Anton; Swan, Russell; Byrd, Donald","description":"We are interested in how ideas from document clustering can be used to improve the retrieval accuracy of ranked lists in interactive systems. In particular, we are interested in ways to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems to decide how they might best be constructed. In this study, we construct and evaluate systems that present the user with ranked lists and a visualization of inter-document similarities. We first carry out a user study to evaluate the clustering/ranked list combination on instance-oriented retrieval, the task of the TREC-6 Interactive Track. We find that although users generally prefer the combination, they are not able to use it to improve effectiveness. In the second half of this study, we develop and evaluate an approach that more directly combines the ranked list with information from inter-document similarities. Using the TREC collections and relevance judgments, we show that it is possible to realize substantial improvements in effectiveness by doing so, and that although users can use the combined information effectively, the system can provide hints that substantially improve on the user's solo effort. The resulting approach shares much in common with an interactive application of incremental relevance feedback. Throughout this study, we illustrate our work using two prototype systems constructed for these evaluations. The first, AspInQuery, is a classic information retrieval system augmented with a specialized tool for recording information about instances of relevance. The other system, Lighthouse, is a Web-based application that combines a ranked list with a portrayal of inter-document similarity.

In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to gather data from 25 lecturers and librarians, and results analysed using the grounded theory method. Webaccessible DLs are identified as changing the roles and working patterns of academic staff (i.e. lecturers, librarians and computer support staff). However, poor accessibility due to inappropriate implementation strategies, access mechanisms, searching support & DL usability reduces the use of these resources. Consequently, web and personal collections without guarantees of quality are widely used as an accessible alternative.

Each textual snippet shows a content summary of the referred document (or webpage) and a link to it. This display has many advantages, for example, it affords easy navigation and is straightforward to interpret. Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query--for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed--the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a \"bag-of-words\" vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown.","uri":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434226","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-87257770","title":"User interfaces for search","creator":"Hearst, M","description":"","uri":"http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/mir_revision.pdf","facets":{"year":"2011"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-74452544","title":"TileBars: Visualization of Term Distribution Information in Full Text Information Access","creator":"Hearst, Marti","description":"The field of information retrieval has traditionally focused on textbases consisting of titles and abstracts.

The elegant way in which search results are returned is usually remarkably effective. However, for exploratory search in which users need to learn, discover, and understand novel or complex topics, there is substantial room for improvement. Human computer interaction researchers and web browser designers have developed novel strategies to improve Web search by enabling users to conveniently visualize, manipulate, and organize their Web search results. This monograph offers fresh ways to think about search-related cognitive processes and describes innovative design approaches to browsers and related tools. For instance, while key word search presents users with results for specific information (e.g., what is the capitol of Peru), other methods may let users see and explore the contexts of their requests for information (related or previous work, conflicting information), or the properties that associate groups of information assets (group legal decisions by lead attorney). We also consider the both traditional and novel ways in which these strategies have been evaluated. From our review of cognitive processes, browser design, and evaluations, we reflect on the future opportunities and new paradigms for exploring and interacting with Web search results.","uri":"http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265169/","facets":{"year":"2008"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-45000659","title":"FacetScape : A Visualization for Exploring the Search Space","creator":"Seifert, Christin; Jurgovsky, Johannes; Granitzer, Michael","description":"Despite advancing search technologies, informa- tion overload has not yet been solved. Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes in- creasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose FacetScape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the FacetScape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2014"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-93908546","title":"Displaying relevance scores for search results","creator":"Shani, Guy; Tractinsky, N","description":"Internet search engines typically compute a relevance score for webpages given the query terms, and then rank the pages by de- creasing relevance scores.

The results of the study suggested that experience in using computers, web, and web search engines affect the query formulation process. Surprisingly, domain expertise did not have an effect on the query formulation. Generally, experienced users formulated longer and more specific queries whereas the queries of users with less experience consisted of fewer and more generic terms. Based on the previous studies concerning query formulation and the results from the questionnaire study, three main factors affecting query formulation are suggested: 1. Media expertise, 2. Domain expertise, and 3. Type of search. These factors should be taken into account when studying and designing information search systems.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2003"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-19667240","title":"Title and snippet based result re-ranking in collaborative Web search","creator":"Boydell, Oisín; Smyth, Barry","description":"Collaborative Web search is a form of meta-search that manipulates the results of underlying Web search engines in response to the learned preferences of a given community of users.

Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops. We see our work as a step towards introducing user controlled classification methods in addition to text search and filtering for increasing recall in analytics scenarios involving large corpora.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2012"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-70495730","title":"The Visual Exploration of Web Search Results Using HotMap","creator":"Hoeber, Orland; Yang, Xue Dong","description":"While the information retrieval techniques used by web search engines have improved substantially over the years, the search results have continued to be represented in a sim- ple list-based format.

Images are indexed based on the text that is related to the images. Queries are matched to this text to produce a set of search results, which are organized in paged grids that are remi- niscent of lists of documents. Due to ambiguity both with user-supplied queries and with the text used to describe the images within the search index, most image searches contain many irrelevant images distributed throughout the search results, and are often focused on the most common interpretation of the query. We propose a method for addressing these problems in which conceptual query expansion is used to generate a diverse range of images, and a multi-resolution extension of a self-organizing map is used to group visually similar images. The resulting interface acts as an intelligent search assistant, automati- cally diversifying the search results and then allowing the searcher to interactively highlight and filter images based on the concepts, and zoom into an area within the image space to show additional images that are visually similar. Evaluations show that the precision of the image search results increase as a result of concept-based focusing and filtering, as well as visual zooming operations, even for uncommon interpretations of ambiguous queries.","uri":"","facets":{"year":"2013"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-67900385","title":"Apolo : Making Sense of Large Network Data by Combining Rich User Interaction and Machine Learning","creator":"Horng, Duen; Chau, Polo; Kittur, Aniket; Hong, Jason I; Faloutsos, Christos","description":"Extracting useful knowledge from large network datasets has become a fundamental challenge in many domains, from sci- entific literature to social networks and the web.

However, the problems start as soon as mail volumes go beyond the scope of human information processing capabilities. Firstly, time does not allow for leaving certain messages unanswered for a long time, and in certain cases, for reading all messages. Secondly, the dilemma of electronic filters leaves a choice of too many junk mails getting through versus a risk of solicited mails being dumped. In this paper we present a new interactive visual data mining approach for analyzing individual e-mail commu- nication. It combines classical visual analytics (help to identify pattern such as peaks and trends over time) with geo-spatial map distortions (help to understand the routes of e-mails). Experiments show that our visual e-mail explorer produces useful and interesting visualizations of large collections of e-mail and is practical for exploring temporal and geo-spatial patterns hidden in the e-mail data.","uri":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2384100","facets":{"year":"2005"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-45095439","title":"Metadata visualization of scholarly search results: supporting exploration and discovery","creator":"Khazaei, Taraneh; Hoeber, Orland","description":"Studies of online search behaviour have found that searchers often face difficulties formulating queries and exploring the search results sets.

This paper addresses assistance of query composition and search result visualization. Query formulation is considered to be an iterative process. After one query is run, the AST vertices neighbored to the result vertices are analyzed to propose refinement options for the next query.

To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds.

Search is one of the keys to the Webs success. The elegant way in which search results are returned has been well researched and is usually remarkably effective. However, the body of work produced by decades of research into information retrieval continues to grow rapidly and so it has become hard to synthesize the current state-of-the-art to produce a search interface that is both highly functional, but not cluttered and distracting. Further, recent work has shown that there is substantial room for improving the support provided to users who are exhibiting more exploratory forms of search, including when users may need to learn, discover, and understand novel or complex topics. Overall, there is a recognized need for search systems to provide effective user experiences that do more than simply return results. With the aim of producing more effective search interfaces, human computer interaction researchers and web designers have been developing novel interactions and features that enable users to conveniently visualize, parse, manipulate, and organize their Web search results. For instance, while a simple set of results may produce specific information (e.g., the capital of Peru), other methods may let users see and explore the contexts of their requests for information (more about the country, city, and nearby attractions), or the properties that associate groups of information assets (grouping hotels, restaurants, and attractions by their type, district, or price). Other techniques support information-seeking processes that may last weeks or months or may even require collaboration between multiple searchers. The choice of relevant result visualization strategies in new search systems should reflect the searchers and the higher-level information needs that motivate their searches. These examples provide further motivation for supporting designers, who are challenged to synthesize and understand the breadth of advances in search, so that they can determine the benefits of varied strategies and apply them appropriately to build better systems. To support researchers and designers in synthesizing and understanding the advances in search, this monograph offers a structured means to think about web search result visualization, based on an inclusive model of search that integrates information retrieval, information seeking and a higher-level context of tasks and goals. We examine each of these levels of search in a survey of advances in browsers and related tools by defining search-related cognitive processes and analyzing innovative design approaches. We then discuss evaluations at each of these levels of search, presenting significant results and identifying both the traditional and novel means used to produce them. Based on this examination, we propose taxonomy of search result visualization techniques that can be used to identify gaps for future research and as a reference for designers of next generation web search systems.","uri":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1734791","facets":{"year":"2010"}},{"id":"doc-DS_SRV-94028560","title":"Periscope – A System for Adaptive 3D Visualization of Search Results","creator":"Wiza, Wojciech; Walczak, Krzysztof; Cellary, Wojciech","description":"A system for efficient 3D visualization of Web search results is presented.

Two questions are considered in this paper: what and when to communicate. To answer these questions, we developed a human-robot communication framework which makes use of common probabilistic robotics representations. The data stored in the representation determines what to communicate, and probabilistic inference mechanisms determine when to communicate. One application domain of the framework is collaborative human-robot decision making: robots use decision theory to select actions based on perceptual information gathered from their sensors and human operators. In this paper, operators are regarded as remotely located, valuable information sources which need to be managed carefully. Robots decide when to query operators using Value-Of-Information theory, i.e. humans are only queried if the expected benefit of their observation exceeds the cost of obtaining it. This can be seen as a mechanism for adjustable autonomy whereby adjustments are triggered at run-time based on the uncertainty in the robots' beliefs related to their task. This semi-autonomous system is demonstrated using a navigation task and evaluated by a user study. Participants navigated a robot in simulation using the proposed system and via classical teleoperation. Results show that our system has a number of advantages over teleoperation with respect to performance, operator workload, usability, and the users' perception of the robot. We also show that despite these advantages, teleoperation may still be a preferable driving mode depending on the mission priorities.

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.","collectionName":"2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2009","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"}},{"id":"9042dc56-5cd2-3148-9d81-c1c97e24fd20","title":"A survey of socially interactive robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-socially-interactive-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-socially-interactive-robots/","creator":"Terrence Fong, Illah Nourbakhsh, Kerstin Dautenhahn","description":"This paper reviews \"socially interactive robots\": robots for which social human-robot interaction is important.

Our gaze model integrates data collected from a human storyteller and a discourse structure model developed by Cassell and her colleagues for human-like conversational agents (1994). We used this model to direct the gaze of a humanoid robot, Honda's ASIMO, as he recited a Japanese fairy tale using a pre-recorded human voice. We assessed the efficacy of this gaze algorithm by manipulating the frequency of ASIMO's gaze between two participants and used pre and post questionnaires to assess whether participants evaluated the robot more positively and did better on a recall task when ASIMO looked at them more. We found that participants performed significantly better in recalling ASIMO's story when the robot looked at them more.

Used together, these modalities lead to effective teaching and learning approaches, respectively. In the robotics domain, task teaching has been mostly addressed by using only one or very few of these interactions. In this paper we present an approach for teaching robots that relies on the key features and the general approach people use when teaching each other: first give a demonstration, then allow the learner to refine the acquired capabilities by practicing under the teacher's supervision, involving a small number of trials. Depending on the quality of the learned task, the teacher may either demonstrate it again or provide specific feedback during the learner's practice trial for further refinement. Also, as people do during demonstrations, the teacher can provide simple instructions and informative cues, increasing the performance of learning. Thus, instructive demonstrations, generalization over multiple demonstrations and practice trials are essential features for a successful human-robot teaching approach. We implemented a system that enables all these capabilities and validated these concepts with a Pioneer 2DX mobile robot learning tasks from multiple demonstrations and teacher feedback.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the Second International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent systems - AAMAS '03","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2003"}},{"id":"4ef8d4ea-8b4a-379d-85af-91b929ffdc57","title":"Can robots be teammates?: Benchmarks in human–robot teams.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/robots-teammates-benchmarks-humanrobot-teams/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/robots-teammates-benchmarks-humanrobot-teams/","creator":"Victoria Groom, Clifford Nass","description":"The team has become a popular model to organize joint human–robot behavior.

This has resulted in interaction and actuation which is characteristic for machines. When constructing adaptive LEGO robots, we take another view, namely that the robot should resemble a human (or a biological creature) rather than a machine. This has implications on the interaction, actuation and control of the robot. I describe how the robot-as-human approach is investigated in a number of LEGO Mindstorms robot applications. These include making facial expressions, which allows a LEGO robot to express internal \"moods\", and thereby we might achieve a better human-robot interaction. Another application is the Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot. The Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot's control is based on a modular behaviour system, where a number of the modules are evolved neural networks. Further, the Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot has a number of internal drives such as restlessness and hunger, which allow the robot to react on the internal drives. The human-robot interaction is facilitated by allowing the human to train the LEGO pet robot (rather than to program the robot) to make associations between spoken words (via speech recognition) and evolved behaviour.

He surveys the hardware implementations of more than 300 current systems, reviews some of their application areas, and examines the underlying technology, including control, architectures, learning, manipulation, grasping, navigation, and mapping. Living systems can be considered the prototypes of autonomous systems, and Bekey explores the biological inspiration that forms the basis of many recent developments in robotics.

Such capability is desirable in tasks such as earthquake search and rescue and battlefield surveillance and scouting, where robots must go through unexpected situations and obstacles and perform tasks that are difficult for fixed-shape robots. The capabilities of the robots are determined by the design specification of their modules. In this paper, we present the design specification of a CONRO module, a small, self-sufficient and relatively homogeneous module that can be connected to other modules to form complex robots. These robots have not only the capability of changing their shape (intra-robot metamorphing) but also can split into smaller robots or merge with other robots to create a single larger robot (inter-robot metamorphing), i.e., CONRO robots can alter their shape and their size. Thus, heterogeneous robot teams can be built with homogeneous components. Furthermore, the CONRO robots can separate the reconfiguration stage from the locomotion stage, allowing the selection of configuration-dependent gaits. The locomotion and automatic inter-module docking capabilities of such robots were tested using tethered prototypes that can be reconfigured manually.

For multi-robot tasks such as exploration of large environments, some of the available robots may only possess simple embedded controllers with limited memory capacity. However, in some situations these limited robots may be required to perform global path planning to navigate beyond localised regions of the large environment. Global path planning can be problematic for the limited memory robots if they are unable to store the entire map in their local memory. Hence, this paper presents and evaluates a two-tiered path planning technique to permit global path planning. A set of local maps describing the global map is searched using a two-tiered A* algorithm that executes entirely on the limited memory robots. Planning time, data communication and path length are evaluated for various combinations of local and global maps. Employing smaller local map sizes in large global maps is capable of yielding superior or comparable execution times to non-memory constrained planning. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process-one might argue, the key component-is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, those policies must be robust to signal noise or unexpected situations, scalable to more complex environments, and account for the physical limitations of the robots (e.g., limited battery power and computational power).

Autonomy in this robot has been improved from other robots at three different levels: with an increased battery life (estimated twice of the competitors), with the ability to autonomously navigate in indoor environments while avoiding obstacles, and by integrating all the control systems within the robot itself.","collectionName":"2008 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, Humanoids 2008","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2008"}},{"id":"31426089-8a0a-34ee-a0d5-87c10bf76eab","title":"An architecture for cooperative and autonomous mobile robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/architecture-cooperative-autonomous-mobile-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/architecture-cooperative-autonomous-mobile-robots/","creator":"F.R.

Especially during the two recent DARPA grand challenges, autonomous cars have been shown to robustly navigate over extended periods of time through complex desert courses or through dynamic urban traffic environments. In these tasks, the robots typically relied on GPS traces to follow pre-defined trajectories so that only local planners were required. In this paper, we present an approach for autonomous navigation of cars in indoor structures such as parking garages. Our approach utilizes multi-level surface maps of the corresponding environments to calculate the path of the vehicle and to localize it based on laser data in the absence of sufficiently accurate GPS information. It furthermore utilizes a local path planner for controlling the vehicle. In a practical experiment carried out with an autonomous car in a real parking garage we demonstrate that our approach allows the car to autonomously park itself in a large-scale multi-level structure.","collectionName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"}},{"id":"4bf6ee17-bc2a-3c22-a1ba-63973406b22d","title":"Autonomous manipulation with a general-purpose simple hand","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/autonomous-manipulation-generalpurpose-simple-hand/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/autonomous-manipulation-generalpurpose-simple-hand/","creator":"M.

We first introduce the field of autonomous flying robots, reviewing the most relevant contributes on this research field and highlighting the elements of novelty contained in our approach. We then describe the simulation model we have elaborated and the results obtained in different experimental scenarios. In all experiments, MAV teams made by four agents have to navigate autonomously through an unknown environment, reach a certain target and finally neutralize it through a self-detonation. The different setups comprise an environment with various obstacles (skyscrapers) and a fixed target, one with a moving target, and one where the target (fixed or moving) needs to be attacked cooperatively in order to be neutralized. The results obtained show how the evolved controllers are able to perform the various tasks with an accuracy level between 72% and 94% when the target has to be approached individually. The performance slightly decreases only when the target is both able to move and can only be neutralized through a coordinated operation.

By combining strongly heterogeneous robots the diversity of achievable tasks increases as the variety of sensing and motion abilities of the robot system is extended, compared to a usually considered team of homogeneous robots. A number of methodologies and technologies required in order to achieve the long-term goal of cooperation of heterogeneous autonomous robots are discussed, including modeling tasks and robot abilities, task assignment and redistribution, robot behavior modeling and programming, robot middleware and robot simulation. Example solutions and their application to the cooperation of autonomous wheeled and humanoid robots are presented in this case study. The scenario describes a tightly coupled cooperative task, where the humanoid robot and the wheeled robot track a moving ball, which is to be approached and kicked by the humanoid robot into a goal. The task can be fulfilled successfully by combining the abilities of both robots. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Developmental Psychology, 36, 5, 627-634.], we investigated whether 10-month-old infants expected people to talk to a humanoid robot.

In subsequent test trials, the infants were shown another actor talking to the robot and to the actor. We found that infants who had previously observed the interactive robot showed no difference in looking-time between the two types of test events. Infants in the other conditions, however, looked longer at the test event where the second experimenter talked to the robot rather than where the second experimenter talked to the person. These results suggest that infants interpret the interactive robot as a communicative agent and the non-interactive robot as an object.

Imitation learning focuses on three important issues: efficient motor learning, the connection between action and perception, and modular motor control in the form of movement primitives. It is reviewed here how research on representations of, and functional connections between, action and perception have contributed to our understanding of motor acts of other beings. The recent discovery that some areas in the primate brain are active during both movement perception and execution has provided a hypothetical neural basis of imitation. Computational approaches to imitation learning are also described, initially from the perspective of traditional Al and robotics, but also from the perspective of neural network models and statistical-learning research. Parallels and differences between biological and computational approaches to imitation are highlighted and an overview of current projects that actually employ imitation learning for humanoid robots is given.","collectionName":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1999"}},{"id":"914d84c8-8fd8-39e9-9d25-7e7332325979","title":"Footstep planning for the Honda ASIMO humanoid","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/footstep-planning-honda-asimo-humanoid/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/footstep-planning-honda-asimo-humanoid/","creator":"Joel Chestnutt, Manfred Lau, German Cheung, James Kuffner, Jessica Hodgins, Takeo Kanade","description":"  Despite the recent achievements in stable dynamic walking for many humanoid robots, relatively little navigation autonomy has been achieved.

The modular architecture of the MOSAIC model can be useful for solving nonlinear and non-stationary control problems. Both humans and humanoid robots have nonlinear body dynamics and many degrees of freedom. Since they can interact with environments (e.g., carrying objects), control strategies need to deal with non-stationary dynamics. Therefore, MOSAIC has strong potential as a human motor-control model and a control framework for humanoid robots. Yet application of the MOSAIC model has been limited to simple simulated dynamics since it is susceptive to observation noise and also cannot be applied to partially observable systems. Our approach introduces state estimators into MOSAIC architecture to cope with real environments.

Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms \"real\" and \"virtual\" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these.

Augmented reality systems overlay computer-generated graphical information over the view of the real world. Several main research challenges can be identified in the field of augmented reality. These are the design of advanced display devices (e.g., head-mounted displays), camera tracking, system design, user interaction, and rendering. While a major part of the previous work focused on the problems of system design, camera tracking, and applications of AR, this thesis puts a different emphasis on the relatively underrepresented aspect of rendering techniques. In this thesis, several novel methods for displaying augmented video streams are explored. In the first part of this thesis in Chapter 2, the design and implementation of a novel system for medical augmented reality are discussed. The ARGUS framework is a new augmented reality system based on a commercial surgical navigation device. Since it does not require any additional hardware components, a transition into the clinical practice can be facilitated. Several extensions of the basic framework are described, including a hybrid tracking scheme, a user interaction library, and amethod for handling occlusion. The latter algorithm makes it possible to correctly render the occlusion of graphical objects by the anatomy of the patient, leading to a more realistic and easily comprehensible output. This approach is one of the advanced rendering methods for augmented reality investigated in the context of this thesis. The second part of this thesis, Chapter 3, introduces the concept of stylized augmented reality, which applies artistic or illustrative stylization methods to augmented reality video streams. Since the same type of stylization is applied to virtual and real scene elements, they become difficult to distinguish. This way, a novel augmented reality experience is created, and possibly even a better immersion. Real-time algorithms for cartoon-like and painterly brush stroke stylization of augmented video streams are described. The exploitation of programmable graphics hardware for this purpose is discussed. Moreover, the results of a psychophysical study on the discernability of virtual objects in stylized augmented reality are presented. At the beginning of Chapter 4, which is the third part of this thesis, a novel illustrative visualization method is described. This new rendering algorithm for iso-surfaces and polygonal models generates an illustrative representation of a surface and structures hidden behind it. The method is designed for the programmable rendering pipelines of modern graphics hardware and is capable of displaying complex models in real-time. An extension of this newly developed illustrative display style was also applied to augmented reality video streams. This system constitutes another realization of the concept of stylized augmented reality.","collectionName":"Arbeit","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2006"}},{"id":"4ce6bd90-f63b-3fc3-be43-39ccb8ded1a2","title":"Augmented reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/augmented-reality-class-displays-realityvirtuality-continuum/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/augmented-reality-class-displays-realityvirtuality-continuum/","creator":"Paul; Haruo Takemura; Akira Utsumi; Fumio Kishino Milgram","description":"In this paper we discuss augmented reality (AR) displays in a general sense, within the context of a reality-virtuality (RV) continuum, encompassing a large class of `mixed reality' (MR) displays, which also includes augmented virtuality (AV).

They are usually integrated into virtual reality scenarios where additional data such as sound, text or video can be introduced, leading to multimedia virtual environments. These environments allow users both to navigate and interact on different platforms such as desktop PCs, laptops and small hand-held devices (mobile phones or PDAs). In very recent years, a new technology derived from virtual reality has emerged: Augmented Reality (AR), which is based on mixing real and virtual environments to boost human interactions and real-life navigations. The synergy of AR and photogrammetry opens up new possibilities in the field of 3D data visualization, navigation and interaction far beyond the traditional static navigation and interaction in front of a computer screen. In this paper we introduce a low-cost outdoor mobile AR application to integrate buildings of different urban spaces. High-accuracy 3D photo-models derived from close-range photogrammetry are integrated in real (physical) urban worlds. The augmented environment that is presented herein requires for visualization a see-through video head mounted display (HMD), whereas user's movement navigation is achieved in the real world with the help of an inertial navigation sensor. After introducing the basics of AR technology, the paper will deal with real-time orientation and tracking in combined physical and virtual city environments, merging close-range photogrammetry and AR. There are, however, some software and complex issues, which are discussed in the paper. &amp;copy; 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Except a pair of video cameras, without any other sensors or artificial markers, users can use real rackets to hit virtual ping-pong ball on a virtual table and interact with remote partners in augmented reality scene just as they were playing ping-pong in the same place. First, the real racket can be detected and tracked in real-time in the video captured by a single camera in each site. By 3D registration, the real racket can seamlessly interact with the virtual ping-pong ball and table. Then, a communication scheme is designed for the consistent perception between users in collaborative augmented reality ping-pong system. To achieve real-time interaction, the whole method is implemented in a parallel computing environment through multi-core processors. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can provide consistent perception and natural user interaction with low latency and high precision.","collectionName":"Proceedings - 2011 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization, ICVRV 2011","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"}},{"id":"b38d8fa2-7dc9-3575-af22-5284694d84d7","title":"Real-time markerless tracking for augmented reality: The virtual visual servoing framework","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/realtime-markerless-tracking-augmented-reality-virtual-visual-servoing-framework/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/realtime-markerless-tracking-augmented-reality-virtual-visual-servoing-framework/","creator":"Andrew I. Comport, Eric Marchand, Muriel Pressigout, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Chaumette","description":"Tracking is a very important research subject in a real-time augmented reality context. The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a \"video see through\" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2006"}},{"id":"432c7359-3645-3296-b0cb-a7eade1daf8f","title":"Explorations in the Use of Augmented Reality for Geographic Visualization","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/explorations-augmented-reality-geographic-visualization/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/explorations-augmented-reality-geographic-visualization/","creator":"Nicholas R.

A number of techniques and technologies are now in use. These include EDM, GPS, and photogrammetric application, remote sensing and traditional building surveying applications. However, use of these technologies cannot be practical and efficient in regard to time, cost and accuracy. Furthermore, a multi disciplinary knowledge base, created from the studies and research about the regeneration aspects is fundamental: historical, architectural, archeologically, environmental, social, economic, etc. In order to have an adequate diagnosis of regeneration, it is necessary to describe buildings and surroundings by means of documentation and plans. However, at this point in time the foregoing is considerably far removed from the real situation, since more often than not it is extremely difficult to obtain full documentation and cartography, of an acceptable quality, since the material, constructive pathologies and systems are often insufficient or deficient (flat that simply reflects levels, isolated photographs,..). Sometimes the information in reality exists, but this fact is not known, or it is not easily accessible, leading to the unnecessary duplication of efforts and resources. In this paper, we discussed 3D laser scanning technology, which can acquire high density point data in an accurate, fast way. Besides, the scanner can digitize all the 3D information concerned with a real world object such as buildings, trees and terrain down to millimetre detail Therefore, it can provide benefits for refurbishment process in regeneration in the Built Environment and it can be the potential solution to overcome the challenges above. The paper introduce an approach for scanning buildings, processing the point cloud raw data, and a modelling approach for CAD extraction and building objects classification by a pattern matching approach in IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format. The approach presented in this paper from an undertaken research can lead to parametric design and Building Information Modelling (BIM) for existing structures. Two case studies are introduced to demonstrate the use of laser scanner technology in the Built Environment. These case studies are the Jactin House Building in East Manchester and the Peel building in the campus of University Salford. Through these case studies, while use of laser scanners are explained, the integration of it with various technologies and systems are also explored for professionals in Built Environment","collectionName":"Automation in Construction","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2007"}},{"id":"3fe4a058-1f8b-32ec-8a74-a9cfc7ae18b4","title":"Missing data analysis: making it work in the real world.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/missing-data-analysis-making-it-work-real-world-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/missing-data-analysis-making-it-work-real-world-1/","creator":"John W Graham","description":"This review presents a practical summary of the missing data literature, including a sketch of missing data theory and descriptions of normal-model multiple imputation (MI) and maximum likelihood methods.

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.","collectionName":"Annual review of psychology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"}},{"id":"326b56ed-02e4-3510-a6c0-d3f0dcd8cae0","title":"Annotating real-world objects using augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/annotating-realworld-objects-using-augmented-reality-12/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/annotating-realworld-objects-using-augmented-reality-12/","creator":"Eric Rose, Eric Rose, David Breen, David Breen, Klaus H.

The visual augmentation is also performed using a video projector that project's the diagrams on the hand as it moves.","collectionName":"2012 IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, IECBES 2012","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2012"}},{"id":"c30582e7-eb4f-3c8d-a8e3-8f5e36a90775","title":"Evaluating label placement for augmented reality view management","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluating-label-placement-augmented-reality-view-management/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluating-label-placement-augmented-reality-view-management/","creator":"R.

This paper represents the first study in an actual AR application of a specific view management task: evaluating the placement of 2D virtual labels that identify information about real counterparts. Here, we objectively evaluated four different placement algorithms, including a novel algorithm for placement based on identifying existing clusters. The evaluation included both a statistical analysis of traditional metrics (e.g. counting overlaps) and an empirical user study guided by principles from human cognition. The numerical analysis of the three real-time algorithms revealed that our new cluster-based method recorded the best average placement accuracy while requiring only relatively moderate computation time. Measures of objective readability from the user study demonstrated that in practice, human subjects were able to read labels fastest with the algorithms that most quickly prevented overlap, even if placement wasn't ideal.","collectionName":"The Second IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, 2003.

Over the past two decades, we have designed, built, worn, and tested many different embodiments of this device in the context of wearable computing. Incorporated into the Reality Mediator is an &ldquo;EyeTap&rdquo; system, which is a device that quantifies and resynthesizes light that would otherwise pass through one or both lenses of the eye(s) of a wearer. The functional principles of EyeTap devices are discussed, in detail. The EyeTap diverts into a spatial measurement system at least a portion of light that would otherwise pass through the center of projection of at least one lens of an eye of a wearer. The Reality Mediator has at least one mode of operation in which it reconstructs these rays of light, under the control of a wearable computer system. The computer system then uses new results in algebraic projective geometry and comparametric equations to perform head tracking, as well as to track motion of rigid planar patches present in the scene. We describe how our tracking algorithm allows an EyeTap to alter the light from a particular portion of the scene to give rise to a computer-controlled, selectively mediated reality. An important difference between mediated reality and augmented reality includes the ability to not just augment but also deliberately diminish or otherwise alter the visual perception of reality. For example, diminished reality allows additional information to be inserted without causing the user to experience information overload. Our tracking algorithm also takes into account the effects of automatic gain control, by performing motion estimation in both spatial as well as tonal motion coordinates.","collectionName":"Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2002"}},{"id":"e48aa505-f3b0-37c1-b02a-19860456ff83","title":"Multiview paraperspective projection model for diminished reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiview-paraperspective-projection-model-diminished-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiview-paraperspective-projection-model-diminished-reality/","creator":"S.

In fact, the structure of many real-world scenes is governed by strong configurational rules akin to those that apply to a single object. Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes.","collectionName":"International Journal of Computer Vision","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2003"}},{"id":"27ef8028-7b52-386a-a98f-abc671ed9756","title":"Context-based vision system for place and object recognition","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/contextbased-vision-system-place-object-recognition/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/contextbased-vision-system-place-object-recognition/","creator":"A.

We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types.

Motivated by local distance learning, where a novel view of an object is compared to individual views of previously seen objects, we define a view-to-object distance where a novel view is compared simultaneously to all views of a previous object. This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded. This significantly reduces computational cost without compromising recognition accuracy. We evaluate the proposed technique, Instance Distance Learning (IDL), on the RGB-D Object Dataset, which consists of 300 object instances in 51 everyday categories and about 250,000 views of objects with both RGB color and depth. We empirically compare IDL to several alternative state-of-the-art approaches and also validate the use of visual and shape cues and their combination.","collectionName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"}},{"id":"7f2098ad-ad73-3429-9640-be3945f5cc87","title":"Multiclass object recognition with sparse, localized features","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiclass-object-recognition-sparse-localized-features/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiclass-object-recognition-sparse-localized-features/","creator":"Jim Mutch, David G.

We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, this trend is changing with the exponential growth of information and communications technologies (ICT), giving many Sub-Sahara African women access to computers, the Internet, and other related technologies.

We do so by examining major bottlenecks and enablers to such integration from historical and contemporary perspectives. Using an interpretive approach, we conducted 32 interviews with women in an ICT program offered by a university in Kenya. Our findings indicate that women were highly optimistic, embracing ICT as a practical mechanism for achieving entry into the labor market. However, they perceived significant structural barriers, such as public policies that failed to facilitate the development of the ICT sector, gender discrimination by employers, and training that provided them with insufficient technical skills to enable them to effectively perform in the workplace. These findings largely confirm the gendered perspectives found in similar studies conducted in other countries. However, what appear as global perspectives are informed by the local causes.","collectionName":"The Information Society","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"}},{"id":"5a28b138-15fb-3733-a8d8-bfe427fb7c63","title":"Women in the workforce and family structure in Australia","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/women-workforce-family-structure-australia/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/women-workforce-family-structure-australia/","creator":"Anne Daly","description":"The purpose of this paper is to set out some of the changes that have taken place in the economic status of women in Australia and to discuss the relationship between economic factors and family structure.

Much of the research on gender and IT assumes a unilateral effect: all organizational factors affect all women in the same ways. An alternative view that is explored in this research is that within gender differences offer rich insights into the gender imbalance in the IT profession. The individual differences theory of gender and IT enabled us to examine variation in organizational influences on women through analysis of transcripts from in-depth interviews conducted with 92 women in the IT workforce in the U.S.A. The results show that three organizational factors – work–life balance, organizational climate, and mentoring – affected the women’s career development in a range of ways. Our findings shed new light on what has been interpreted by other researchers as contradictory findings because our theoretical starting point is the assumption that women are not all the same, that within-gender variation is expected and that it provides an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of gender relations in the IT field. Using this theory we were able to identify opportunities for the development of interventions by linking the themes embedded in the three workplace factors to the constructs of the theory. The individual identity construct revealed the ways in which a woman’s demographic and professional characteristics affect her career choices. The individual influences construct focused attention on the ways in which differences in personality, abilities, and influential people shape one’s career. Finally, the environmental influences construct characterized contextual influences on women’s participation in the IT profession. Our findings show that both research and interventions directed at increasing the retention of women must be flexible enough to respond to the variation that exists among women and within IT workplaces.","collectionName":"European Journal of Information Systems","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009"}},{"id":"bdbc6cdc-043f-35a9-ba63-c3b89c6b2fe3","title":"Women in the UK academic medicine workforce","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-uk-academic-medicine-workforce/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-uk-academic-medicine-workforce/","creator":"Bhupinder Sandhu, Ceri Margerison, Anita Holdcroft","description":"OBJECTIVES: \nThis study aimed to compare data on the employment profiles (such as grade, place of work, etc.) of male and female clinical academics. \nMETHODS: \nWe carried out a comparative review of workforce data within academic medicine for 2004 and 2005, pertaining to the workforce in all specialties in UK medical schools. \nRESULTS: \nWe identified 3255 and 3365 lecturers, senior lecturers, readers and professors in 2004 and 2005, respectively, of whom 21% were women.

No empirically based analysis of the causes and implications of this aging workforce exists. \nOBJECTIVES: \nTo identify and assess key sources of changes in the age distribution and total supply of RNs and to project the future age distribution and total RN workforce up to the year 2020. \nDESIGN AND SETTING: \nRetrospective cohort analysis of employment trends of recent RN cohorts over their lifetimes based on US Bureau of the Census Current Population Surveys between 1973 and 1998. Recent workforce trends were used to forecast long-term age and employment of RNs. \nPARTICIPANTS: \nEmployed RNs aged 23 to 64 years (N = 60,386). \nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \nAnnual full-time equivalent employment of RNs in total and by single year of age. \nRESULTS: \nThe average age of working RNs increased by 4.5 years between 1983 and 1998. The number of full-time equivalent RNs observed in recent cohorts has been approximately 35% lower than that observed at similar ages for cohorts that entered the labor market 20 years earlier. Over the next 2 decades, this trend will lead to a further aging of the RN workforce because the largest cohorts of RNs will be between age 50 and 69 years. Within the next 10 years, the average age of RNs is forecast to be 45.4 years, an increase of 3.5 years over the current age, with more than 40% of the RN workforce expected to be older than 50 years. The total number of full-time equivalent RNs per capita is forecast to peak around the year 2007 and decline steadily thereafter as the largest cohorts of RNs retire. By the year 2020, the RN workforce is forecast to be roughly the same size as it is today, declining nearly 20% below projected RN workforce requirements. \nCONCLUSIONS: \nThe primary factor that has led to the aging of the RN workforce appears to be the decline in younger women choosing nursing as a career during the last 2 decades. Unless this trend is reversed, the RN workforce will continue to age, and eventually shrink, and will not meet projected long-term workforce requirements.

It also explores how women contested this ascendancy of the male discourse and engineered alternative plots. From the moral gymnasium of the shop floor to the staging grounds of World's Fairs, engineers, inventors, social scientists, activists, and novelists emplotted and questioned technology as our modern male myth. Oldenziel recounts the history of technology - both as intellectual construct and material practice - by analyzing these struggles. Drawing on a broad range of sources, she explains why male machines rather than female fabrics have become the modern markers of technology. She shows how technology developed as a narrative production of modern manliness, allowing women little room for negotiation.

Although the average salary of men was higher than that of women in 1980 and 1986, women actually received greater numbers of promotions, as well as larger percentage salary increases between 1980 and 1986. One reason for women's salary growth advantage was the higher average performance ratings of women between 1980 and 1986.

By using a natural field experiment that randomizes nearly 2,500 job-seekers into jobs that vary important details of the labor contract, we are able to observe both the nature of sorting and the extent of salary negotiations. We observe interesting data patterns. For example, we find that when there is no explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate than women. However, when we explicitly mention the possibility that wages are negotiable, this difference disappears, and even tends to reverse. In terms of sorting, we find that men in contrast to women prefer job environments where the ‘rules of wage determination’ are ambiguous. This leads to the gender gap being much more pronounced in jobs that leave negotiation of wage ambiguous.","collectionName":"Quarterly Journal of Economics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012"}},{"id":"ee82c368-07e7-36f4-b432-c5f9929a2ce2","title":"Men, women, and money: Exploring the role of gender, gender-linkage of college major and career-information sources in salary expectations","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/men-women-money-exploring-role-gender-genderlinkage-college-major-careerinformation-sources-salary-e/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/men-women-money-exploring-role-gender-genderlinkage-college-major-careerinformation-sources-salary-e/","creator":"Kenneth E.

We observe three distinct phases in women's status generated by the gradual increase in women's workforce opportunities. In the earliest phase, characteristic of the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, women earn low wages relative to men and are expected to shoulder all of the child care at home. As a result, most women specialize in home production and raising children. In an intermediate stage, women have improved (but not equal) labor market opportunities, but their household status lags. Women in this stage are still expected to do the majority of child care and household production. Increasing access to market work increases the opportunity cost of having children, and fertility falls. Female labor force participation increases. Working women in this phase of development have the strongest disincentives to having additional children since the entire burden of child care falls on them. In the final phase of development, women's labor market opportunities begin to equal those of men. In addition, the increased household bargaining power that comes from more equal wages results in much higher (if not gender-equal) male participation in household production. Female labor force participation is higher than in the intermediate phase. The increased participation of men in the household also reduces the disincentives for women to have additional children, and fertility rates rise compared to the intermediate phase. The intermediate, low-fertility phase might describe Japan, Italy, and Spain in the present day, while the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, and the modern-day United States may be entering the final phase. After presenting the empirical evidence, we predict that high-income countries with the lowest fertility rates are likely to see an increase in fertility in the coming decades.","collectionName":"The journal of economic perspectives : a journal of the American Economic Association","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008"}},{"id":"98aad57c-9302-310a-b42e-6c4d979b1989","title":"Negotiation for starting salary: Antecedents and outcomes among recent college graduates","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/negotiation-starting-salary-antecedents-outcomes-among-recent-college-graduates/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/negotiation-starting-salary-antecedents-outcomes-among-recent-college-graduates/","creator":"Patrick Gavan O'Shea, David F.

No gender differences were found regarding faculty participants' willingness to negotiate for increased salary; however, males were more likely to negotiate for promotion. Likewise, no gender differences were evident in practitioners' salary and promotion negotiation attempts, although none were expected, given the salary schedule constraints unique to occupations in the field of education. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to one profession, albeit both university faculty and school psychology practitioners, and was conducted in the USA, so the findings may have limited generalizability to other professions and/or in other countries. Practical implications: The paper demonstrates that gender pay differences exist despite no differences in males' and females' willingness to negotiate for salary. Consequently, it is likely that pay differences between men and women are due to reasons other than individuals' education levels, years in position, and negotiation practices. \nOriginality/value: \nThis is the first paper that tracks salaries and the negotiating practices of school psychologist trainers and practitioners.

They chronicle the progress made in education—where female college enrollment now exceeds that of males—and the workforce, where women have entered a wider variety of occupations and are staying on the job longer, even after becoming wives and mothers. But despite progress, lower-paying service and clerical positions remain predominantly female, and although the salary gap between men and women has shrunk, women are still paid less. As women continue to establish a greater presence outside the home, many have delayed marriage and motherhood. Marked jumps in divorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth have given rise to significant numbers of female-headed households. Married women who work contribute more significantly than ever to the financial well-being of their families, yet evidence shows that they continue to perform most household chores. Balancing Act focuses on how American women juggle the simultaneous demands of caregiving and wage earning, and compares their options to those of women in other countries. The United States is the only industrialized nation without policies to support working mothers and their families—most tellingly in the absence of subsidized childcare services. Many women are forced to work in less rewarding part-time or traditionally female jobs that allow easy exit and re-entry, and as a consequence poverty is the single greatest danger facing American women. As the authors show, the risk of poverty varies significantly by race and ethnicity, with African Americans—most of whose children live in mother-only families—the most adversely affected.","collectionName":"Canadian Journal of Urban Research","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1997"}},{"id":"368753f1-cc6b-3af4-88f8-da31a7812f69","title":"Stereotype threat in salary negotiations is mediated by reservation salary","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/stereotype-threat-salary-negotiations-mediated-reservation-salary/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/stereotype-threat-salary-negotiations-mediated-reservation-salary/","creator":"Una Tellhed, Fredrik Björklund","description":"Women are stereotypically perceived as worse negotiators than men, which may make them ask for less salary than men when under stereotype threat (Kray et al., 2001).

A total of 116 business students negotiated salary with a confederate and were either told that this was diagnostic of negotiating ability (threat manipulation) or not. Measures of minimum (reservation) and ideal (aspiration) salary goals and regulatory focus were collected. The finding (Kray et al., 2001) that women make lower salary requests than men when under stereotype threat was replicated. Women in the threat condition further reported lower aspiration salary, marginally significantly lower reservation salary and less eagerness/more vigilance than men. Reservation salary mediated the stereotype threat effect, and there was a trend for regulatory focus to mediate the effect. Thus, reservation salary partly explains why women ask for less salary than men under stereotype threat.

Results from three-level hierarchical linear models, estimated on a unique nested data set drawn from the 2000 Census, suggest that greater representation of women in management does narrow the gender wage gap.

Using hierarchical linear models, the analysis combines individual-level data (obtained from the Luxembourg Income Study) with country-level data (obtained from secondary sources) to evaluate the effects of family policies on gender earnings inequality across 20 advanced societies. The analysis shows that gender earnings disparities are less pronounced in countries with developed family policies. However, the findings also show that if cross-country differences in the wage structure are controlled, the underlying effect of family policy on the gender gap is exposed. Although “mother-friendly” policies enable more women to become economically active, they exacerbate gender occupational inequality. The authors therefore conclude that the lower earnings differentials between men and women in developed welfare states should be attributed to their more egalitarian wage structures rather than to their family policies.","collectionName":"American Sociological Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"}},{"id":"36c960f1-4602-3923-92be-0b29054ba396","title":"Gender wage gaps, 'sticky floors' and 'glass ceilings' in Europe","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-wage-gaps-sticky-floors-glass-ceilings-europe/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-wage-gaps-sticky-floors-glass-ceilings-europe/","creator":"Louis N.

Quantile regressions show that, in a number of countries, the wage gap is wider at the top ('glass ceilings') and/or at the bottom of the wage distribution ('sticky floors'). We find larger mean/median gender gaps and more evidence of glass ceilings for full-time full-year employees, suggesting more female disadvantage in 'better' jobs. These features may be related to country-specific policies that cannot be evaluated at the individual-country level, at a point in time. We use the cross-country variation in the unexplained wage gaps of this larger-than-usual sample of states to explore the influence of (i) country policies that reconcile work and family life and (ii) their wage-setting institutions.

The stylised facts from these studies, summarised in the first part of the paper, are that the gender pay gap in Europe is typically increasing across the wages distribution. This finding - more pronounced in the private than the public sector - has been interpreted as a glass ceiling effect. The existence of this glass ceiling suggests that the average gender pay gap in Europe is mainly due to the gender gap towards the top of the wages distribution. What explains these stylised facts? We briefly outline some relevant hypotheses in the second part of the paper. A fundamental challenge for labour economists is to identify the extent to which these stylised facts are due to policies and institutions, discrimination, to other unobservable factors, or to fundamental differences between men and women. Finally, we briefly summarise the policy initiatives that might be introduced to deal with gender wage gaps.","collectionName":"Swedish Economic Policy Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"}},{"id":"ae2e2d28-0ac0-315b-8bd1-9055eaebc17d","title":"Gender gap in the executive suite: CEOs and female executives report on breaking the glass ceiling.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-gap-executive-suite-ceos-female-executives-report-breaking-glass-ceiling/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-gap-executive-suite-ceos-female-executives-report-breaking-glass-ceiling/","creator":"B.

The findings suggest that all employment-supportive policies and arrangements increase women's relative contribution to the household income through their effect on female labor force participation. Among dual-earner families, however, higher rates of childcare facilities increase women's contribution, while long maternity leave and part-time employment decrease it.

A significant part of this appears to be within observable groups (such as experience-gender-skill cells). A generally untested implication of many theories rationalizing the growth of within-group inequality is that firm-level productivity dispersion should also have increased. We utilize a UK firm-level panel dataset covering the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors since the early 1980s. We find evidence that productivity inequality has increased. Existing studies have typically underestimated this phenomenon because they focus only on the manufacturing sector where inequality has risen much less and which has shrunk rapidly. Most of the increase in individual wage inequality can be accounted for by an increase in inequality between firms (and within industries). Increased productivity dispersion appears to be linked with new technologies as suggested by models such as Caselli (1999, Am. Econ. Rev., 89, 78-102) and is not primarily due to an increase in transitory shocks, greater sorting or entry/exit dynamics.","collectionName":"Industrial and Corporate Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010"}},{"id":"0d81c28a-a891-3da9-b19d-d4718cdf0f76","title":"Changes in wage-and-salary returns to skill and the recent rise in female self-employment","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/changes-wageandsalary-returns-skill-recent-rise-female-selfemployment/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/changes-wageandsalary-returns-skill-recent-rise-female-selfemployment/","creator":"T.

Findings presented in this paper indicate the following: self-employment increased more for females who faced increasing potential earnings in wage-and-salary employment, suggesting that returns to skill were increasing by even more in self-employment; increasing relative returns to skill may explain at least part of the recent rise in female self-employment; there is an absence of a sharp difference in self-employment rates between women in the top and middle segments of the skill distribution: women with relatively low skill levels who faced declining real wages in wage-and-salary employment did not turn to self-employment in the same proportions as women with higher skill levels.

Even so, women’s labor force behavior lies at the heart of most explanations of fertility and fertility change, and many nations, both industrialized and developing, have formulated policies based on the inverse association between these two central aspects of women’s lives. The association between fertility and women’s labor force activity reflects the incompatibility between caring for children and participating in economically productive work that typifies industrialized societies (Weller 1977). Prior to industrialization, work and child rearing tasks could be performed more or less simultaneously. In historical and contemporary preindustrial societies, nonmechanized agricultural tasks and piecework could be combined with child supervision with relatively little danger to the child or marked loss of economic productivity (Degler 1980, Roos 1985, Stycos &Weller 1967). As industrialization proceeded, however, childcare and economically productive work became increasingly incompatible.

Variation, complexity and contradictions may be lost when holding onto essentialist understandings such as the male norm.","collectionName":"Gender, Work and Organization","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"}},{"id":"b9602262-e7ac-3c79-97b5-f40faba6df65","title":"The Myth of the Ideal Worker: Does Doing All The Right Things Really Get Women Ahead?

The short answer is no. Among the high potentials we studied, more than half of both women and men had adopted the full range of advancement strategies attributed to an ideal worker. Furthermore, half of those exemplifying an ideal worker were also including in their repertories external scanning activities - seeking advancement opportunities whether in their current organization or elsewhere-. However, men benefited more than women when they adopted the proactive strategies of the proverbial ideal worker. Even when women used the same career advancement strategies - doing all the things they have been told will help them get ahead - they advanced less than their male counterparts and had slower pay growth.","collectionName":"Catalyst","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"}},{"id":"2cd6ab68-5baf-313b-85d1-da00e01c5ac2","title":"Workforce planning and workplace management","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/workforce-planning-workplace-management/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/workforce-planning-workplace-management/","creator":"L O'Brien-Pallas, S Birch, G T Murphy","description":"Introduction. Literature is scarce on father attendance to labour and delivery and studies report conflicting results. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of father attendance during labour and delivery on pain, anxiety, stress and other variables (irritability, feeling of inefficiency, agitation, worry, lack of self-confidence and ability to relax) perceived by parturient. Methods. An only post-test quasi-experimental design was used. The sample consisted of 200 women in labour. One hundred women (experimental group) were cared for by their partners in the labour and delivery room; another one hundred (control group) were cared for only by the health professionals. Pain, anxiety, stress and other variables were measured using scales of proven validity and reliability. Results. The parturients of the experimental group had a significantly lower pain, anxiety and stress perception than those of the control group. The parturients of the experimental group were also less irritable, agitated, worried, felt more efficient, self-confident and able to relax. Conclusion. The results of this study confirmed part of the literature on the positive effects of father attendance at labour and delivery. This study also contributed to raise major awareness among the health professionals and hospital managers where the control group was recruited on the importance of the support that partners can provide to parturients. Introduction. The spread of palliative care calls for a careful training of the increasing number of health professionals providing assistance to terminally ill patients and their families. One of the skills needed to improve these patients' quality of life is to develop positive attitudes to-wards end-of-life assistance. Among the various tools that assess training needs and efficacy of training programs, the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale (FACTOD Form B ) is an effective and reliable instrument, widely used to analyze this type of attitude among nursing students and health professionals. The aim of the article is to verify the Italian Version (FACTOD Form B-I ), so as to spread the use of these tools also to the palliative care field of our country. Methods. The instrument validation has been developed through the following stages: forward and backward translation, focus groups to assess questions' relevance and vocabulary comprehension, test and retest on a sample of Medicine and Nursing students. Results. The statistical analysis has showed an Interrater Correlation Index between 0.70 and 0.86 for 97% of the items. As for the discriminating capacity, the scale presents good values of asymmetry and kurtosis for most of the items. The internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) is 0.83. On average, the questionnaire has been completed in six minutes and the compilation has been rather easy. Conclusions. FACTOD Form B-I results as a comprehensible instrument, fast and practical to complete, with good psychometric proper-ties, showed by very good values of reproducibility and reliability of the whole scale. Its use in Italy is, therefore, recommended to evaluate the attitude of students and healthcare professionals who take care of terminally ill patients. Introduction. The nursing care based on a delicate balance between \"science of nature\" and \"science of spirit\" can be a powerful antidote to individualism of our own modern society. The feeling of confidence/trust, expressed through a variety of languages (verbal, gestural, bodily) can start a meeting, a relationship, to discover and go beyond the unknown side, that both the patient and the nurse have. Issue. The article is going to analyse the feeling of trust and link it, in particular, to the activity of nursing care. In the first part trust is analysed from a sociological point of view, taking into consideration some of the ideas of Georg Simmel and Niklas Lhumann. A trustful attitude always rises, develops and is verified in set units of time and place, starting from the potential the interlocutors show. In the second part of the article, through the nursing remarks by Jean Watson, the presence of trust as a constituent element in the professional acting is analysed. According to the author, trust is a condition that facilitates the relationship of care, opens the way for the dialogue, encouraging the relationship. Conclusions. The trust is an important feeling in interpersonal relationship. Caring practices, woven into daily technical gestures and always acted through a relationship, need to experiment trust to be effective and consent the realization of a caring project. The trust can't be claimed, it can only be offered or accepted, beginning from a decision in a relationship and people that receive it take an opportunity. Introduction. Therapeutic Touch is an energy-based nursing practice, inside Nursing Interventions Classification , linked with NANDA nursing diagnosis of \"Energy field disturbance\". Introduced and developed by Dolores Krieger, Nursing emeritus professor at the New York University, and Dora Kunz, pranotherapist, today is practiced at nursing in more than eighty hospitals in the world, and more than 43,000 nurses are trained in Therapeutic Touch. Problem. Therapeutic Touch is based on the energy techniques, practiced over the centuries in different continents, on quantum physics, and in the nursing theory, on work by Martha Rogers, the Science of Unitarian Human Beings. In the USA, the Therapeutic Touch, has the scientific and professional support by American Nurses Association and the American Holistic Nurses Association. The scientific evidence seem to indicate that the psychosomatic effects of the Therapeutic Touch, are not only attributable to a placebo effect, but to a direct action of the Therapeutic Touch on an human being energy field, with effects of rebalancing on the energy field configuration. Conclusions. Nurses trained in Therapeutic Touch must develop a very open mind, have a holistic understanding of the human being and reality, and develope consciousness states and a transcendental awareness. Introduction. Anxiety and depression in patients before and after a pacemaker implantation has been understudied despite an increased use of pacemaker therapy in Italy and in the world. The purpose of the present study was to describe and examine anxiety and depression and factors associated with them before a pacemaker implantation and within one year of the post implantation time. Methods. A descriptive, correlational and comparative design has been used to study and compare anxiety and depression in a total sample of 154 patients from two hospitals in Rome, Italy, divided in four groups: 43 patients before the pacemaker implantation, and 38, 29 and 44 patients respectively one, six and twelve months after the implantation. A Sociodemographic Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale have been used to measure the study variables. Results. Anxiety and depression significantly decreased from the pre to the post implantation groups. In the 1-month-post-implantation group patients with a ventricular pacing had lower anxiety and depression levels than those with dual chamber pacing. In the 6-month-post-implantation group patients with a rate responsive pacing were more depressed than those without rate responsive pacing. People less old, less educated, with lower income and fewer children were more anxious and depressed before the implantation. Only older people were more depressed after the implantation. Conclusion. This study provides nurses with a first overview on the phenomenon of anxiety and depression before and after a pacemaker implantation. Knowing the level of anxiety and depression before and after a pacemaker implantation as well as factors associated with these variables helps nurses to provide patients with a better and research based care. Introduction. Those of the urinary tract are the most commonly acquired infections in hospitals. Their prevention is based on the use of indwelling catheters only when a clear clinical indication emerges. The goal of this research is to evaluate the ap ropriateness of the nursing actions commonly used in hospitals to manage the need of urinary elimination in the patients. Methods. Our sample included 200 medical records of people hospitalized in a medical ward during September 2006. The sampling technique was based on the admission date; we used a modified version of Brennan's evaluation scale. Results. 4 medical records have been excluded from the analysis. The mean value of our patients' ages was 74.3 years (SD 15.4). 27 patients (13.8%) had developed some type of infection. Our analysis pointed out that catheters were appropriately used in 95.1% of the sample (39 patients) during their hospitalization, and in two over 16 at the admission. Diapers were used incorrectly in 40 patients (63.4%). Bedpans were correctly used in 41 people (77.3%). Discussion. As regards the need of urinary elimination, the mean age is different between self-sufficient patients and people who use catheters, diapers and/or bedpans. Moreover, we found a difference between the two genders: the percentage of self-sufficient patients is higher among men. Women were using devices more often than men. The highest percentage of incorrectly used devices refers to diapers, with several clinical and social consequences. Introduction. Diabetes mellitus has considerable social impact for its invalidating complications and dramatic outcomes. The prevalence range of foot ulcers in diabetic patients is 4% to 10%. The aim of this paper is to clarify if Clinical Pathway can improve clinical outcomes in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Methods. The Medline and Cinahl databases were searched for articles published between January 1997 and December 2007. Key words used were \"diabetic foot\", \"critical pathway\" e \"clinical protocols\".

The evolutionary process of a circular economy in China, from introduction of the concept and the relevant actions of national decision making to demonstration of the system nationwide, has taken only around 6 years, with strong encouragement from politicians and the urgent need to cope with environmental pollution and a severe shortage of natural resources. The circular economy in China is now being actively implemented at three levels: enterprises, eco-industrial parks, and regions. The consolidated theoretical bases of ecology and economics have helped the circular economy to define its position as a new economic model to effectively resolve the problems of resources and the environment. In this regard, material flow management is naturally a unique planning and management method for implementation of a circular economy, and eco-efficiency is a good indicator to measure circular economic activities. Of particular significance has been initiation of the legislative process for the Circular Economy Law, which is among a number of initiatives developing core policies for a circular economy in China. Stringent enforcement of a set of policies for energy saving and pollution abatement nowadays in China will certainly create an enabling environment for the development of a circular economy.","collectionName":"Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"a99aae2c-726e-3927-bf86-bd258f02bdbb","title":"Towards a Circular Economy - Economic and Business Rationale for an Accelerated Transition","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-economic-business-rationale-accelerated-transition/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-economic-business-rationale-accelerated-transition/","creator":" The Ellen MacArthur Foundation","description":"This report is the first ever to look at the economic and business rationale for an accelerated transition towards a circular economy.

Recent guidelines for LCA (International Reference Life Cycle Data System [ILCD] guidelines) are applied to answer the main research questions in the IS literature reviewed. A typology of five main research questions is proposed: (1) analysis, (2) improvement, and (3) expansion of existing systems; (4) design of new eco-industrial parks, and (5) restructuring of circular economies. The LCA guidelines were found useful in framing the question and choosing an appropriate reference case for comparison. The selection of a correct reference case reduces the risk of overestimating the benefits of by-product exchange. In the analysis of existing systems, environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) can be used to streamline the analysis and provide an industry average baseline for comparison. However, when large-scale changes are applied to the system, more sophisticated tools are necessary for assessment of the consequences, from market analysis to general equilibrium modeling and future scenario work. Such a rigorous application of systems analysis was not found in the current IS literature, but would benefit the field substantially, especially when the environmental impact of large-scale economic changes is analyzed.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"18a48537-9888-3c58-a0cf-d9e33e700500","title":"Cradle to Cradle","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-1/","creator":"William McDonough, Michael Braungart","description":"Architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart argue that human industry need not damage the natural world.

In developed countries, 42% of food waste is produced by households, while 39% losses occur in the food manufacturing industry, 14% in food service sector and remaining 5% in retail and distribution. Increasingly, industrial ecology concepts such as cradle to cradle and circular economy are considered leading principle for eco-innovation, aiming at \"zero waste economy\" in which waste are used as raw material for new products and applications. The large amount of waste produced by the food industry, in addition to being a great loss of valuable materials, also raises serious management problems, both from the economic and environmental point of view. Many of these residues, however, have the potential to be reused into other production systems, trough e.g. biorefineries. The present work focuses on the use of food waste coming from food manufacturing (FWm). Through extensive literature review, the authors present feasibility and constraints of applying industrial symbiosis in recovering waste from food processing, focusing on recycling (excluding energy recovery) of the solid and liquid waste from food processing industry. The main uses of functional ingredients derived from this transformation are presented and discussed, highlighting mainstream sectors of application, e.g. in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Economic globalization requires systems approaches to promote sustainable economic development. The theory of material flow (MF) is one of the new theories that could positively contribute to the economic globalization. The theory of MF is also closely related to the concept of circular economy, as the pattern of material flow can be considered as a closed feedback process for circulatory purpose that is consisted of &amp;lsquo;resources-production-material flow-consumption-recycled resources&amp;rsquo;. It corresponds to the circular economy's development pattern of &amp;lsquo;resources-products-recycled resources&amp;rsquo;. In view of the pattern of material flow and its relevance to the circular economy, it is concluded that the theory of MF will contribute to the recirculation of natural resources, optimal utilization of resources, improving natural environment and especially the sustainable global economic development.

Although Germany and Japan have made important advances in building recycling incentives into their industrial systems and sought competitive advantage from doing so, China is arguably taking the issue even further (in principle) through its pursuit of a circular economy, now enshrined in law as an official national development goal. In this article, we review a number of the eco-industrial initiatives taken in China and compare them using a common graphical representation with comparable initiatives taken in the West and elsewhere in East Asia. Our aim is to demonstrate some common themes across the case studies, such as the transformation from the former linear economy to a circular economy and the evolutionary processes in which dynamic linkages are gradually established over time. We discuss the drivers of these eco-industrial initiatives as well as the inhibitors, setting the initiatives in an evolutionary framework and introducing a notion of Pareto eco-efficiency to evaluate them. We make the argument that China might be capturing latecomer advantages through its systematic promotion of eco-industrial initiatives within a circular economy framework.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"e7c3ec7f-333e-3d5a-999f-d851a4cbdbae","title":"Remaking the industrial economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/remaking-industrial-economy/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/remaking-industrial-economy/","creator":"Hanh Nguyen, Martin Stuchtey, Markus Zils","description":"A regenerative economic model&amp;mdash;the circular economy&amp;mdash; is starting to help companies create more value while reducing their dependence on scarce resources.","collectionName":"McKinsey Quarterly","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"3baf8da8-e6cf-367b-92b9-de13cea940b5","title":"Cradle to cradle: Reverse logistics strategies and opportunities across three industry sectors","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-reverse-logistics-strategies-opportunities-across-three-industry-sectors/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-reverse-logistics-strategies-opportunities-across-three-industry-sectors/","creator":"Sameer Kumar, Valora Putnam","description":"Manufacturers have experienced institutional pressures in the form of market and regulatory demands to conform to the standards dictated by environmental regulations.

Where eco-efficiency and zero emission seek to reduce the unintended negative consequences of processes of production and consumption, eco-effectiveness is a positive agenda for the conception and production of goods and services that incorporate social, economic, and environmental benefit, enabling triple top line growth. Eco-effectiveness moves beyond zero emission approaches by focusing on the development of products and industrial systems that maintain or enhance the quality and productivity of materials through subsequent life cycles. The concept of eco-effectiveness also addresses the major shortcomings of eco-efficiency approaches: their inability to address the necessity for fundamental redesign of material flows, their inherent antagonism towards long-term economic growth and innovation, and their insufficiency in addressing toxicity issues. A central component of the eco-effectiveness concept, cradle-to-cradle design provides a practical design framework for creating products and industrial systems in a positive relationship with ecological health and abundance, and long-term economic growth. Against this background, the transition to eco-effective industrial systems is a five-step process beginning with an elimination of undesirable substances and ultimately calling for a reinvention of products by reconsidering how they may optimally fulfill the need or needs for which they are actually intended while simultaneously being supportive of ecological and social systems. This process necessitates the creation of an eco-effective system of \"nutrient\" management to coordinate the material flows amongst actors in the product system. The concept of intelligent materials pooling illustrates how such a system might take shape, in reality. ?? 2006.","collectionName":"Journal of Cleaner Production","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"213dd1eb-c862-38af-9a1d-ac24409d9278","title":"Towards the Circular Economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-22/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-22/","creator":"Ellen Macarthur","description":"Activities over the past several years, however, clearly show that CE is emerging as an economic strategy rather than a purely environmental strategy.

For treating similar types of waste, projects producing recycled products for special users (e.g., feedstock to a blast furnace for iron production) tended to locate closer to the users than those not producing for special users. The type of waste had a strong effect on the savings of virgin materials and recycling boundaries, while local factors had significant impacts on operational performance. The results also showed that agglomeration did not significantly contribute to the environmental benefits or operational performance of eco-town projects. Another finding was that national agencies were helpful for facilitating cross-prefecture transportation and long-distance transaction of wastes. Implications of the findings are also discussed.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"f7a8c0af-6e4a-3edb-9a6b-ce23da6731dc","title":"Ecological utilization of leather tannery waste with circular economy model","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-utilization-leather-tannery-waste-circular-economy-model/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-utilization-leather-tannery-waste-circular-economy-model/","creator":"Jing Hu, Zuobing Xiao, Rujun Zhou, Weijun Deng, Mingxi Wang, Shuangshuang Ma","description":"Circular economy (CE) focuses on resource-productivity and eco-efficiency improvement in a comprehensive way, especially on the industrial structure optimization of new technology development and application, equipment renewal and management renovation.

Some wastes are reused within the facility where they are generated, others are reused directly by nearby industrial facilities, and some are recycled via the formal and informal recycling markets. Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals. It quantifies the generation of waste materials from 42 companies as well as the materials that are directly traded across facilities and those that are recycled or disposed. This study encompasses a business cluster in Mysore in the State of Karnataka, and is the first in India to thoroughly quantify material flows to identify existing symbiotic connections in an industrial area. Examined industries in this industrial area generate 897,210 metric tons of waste residuals annually, and recovered 99.5% of these, 81% with reused by the companies that generated them, with one company, a sugar refinery, processing most of this amount. Geographic data show that operations within 20km of the industrial area receive over 90% of residuals exiting facility gates. Two-thirds of this amount goes directly to other economic actors for reuse. This study makes key contributions to the literature in distinguishing how particular types of materials are reused in different ways, the geographic extent of symbiotic activities and the important role of the informal sector in industrial waste management in industrializing regions. &amp;copy; 2010 Elsevier B.V.","collectionName":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"e0d84708-9f4e-3dcb-9175-fe4888ca1d0c","title":"Regional industrial ecology: examples from regional economic systems of forest industry and energy supply in Finland.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/regional-industrial-ecology-examples-regional-economic-systems-forest-industry-energy-supply-finland/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/regional-industrial-ecology-examples-regional-economic-systems-forest-industry-energy-supply-finland/","creator":"J Korhonen","description":"Industrial ecology (IE) promotes the development of industrial systems based on recycling of matter and cascading of energy through cooperation.

Commercial businesses and manufacturers are under pressure to be responsible both environmentally and economically in China; the increasing cost of industrial solid waste treatment has led local governments to examine if this service is best provided by the public sector or can better be provided by the private sector. Public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising alternative to improve industrial solid waste management performance with privately owned enterprises often outperforming publicly owned ones. In 2004, an EU-China Environmental Management Cooperation Program (EMCP) of state government agencies, private business, not-for-profits and educational institutions met to discuss the potential for a industrial solid waste exchange in Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) EIP, China. This paper discusses public-private partnerships as a method in which private sector working with government, private business, and educational organizations developed a collaborative statewide program involving the exchange of materials from manufacturers and commercial business in TEDA EIP. The paper also figures out the case of industrial symbiosis network in TEDA and the benefits and challenges gained by related behavior activities during the process of production, development and evolvement of industrial symbiosis network.

In these types of setting, industrial ecology is also often known as industrial symbiosis (IS). The proximity of companies in industrial estates facilitates the linking of utilities and the exchange of wastes and by-products, which may eventually be useful inputs for adjacent industrial processes. The typical model that has been applied in several regions of the world is one where an anchor-tenant organization with energy and by-product linkages is connected to companies physically located nearby. In the case of biomass symbiosis, however, the resource chains are not explicitly arranged by their industrial setting and the supply of waste and by-products is able to be organized in a more scattered way.\\nIn this article, the role of industrial symbiosis is analyzed in respect of the planned industrial symbiosis activities in the Rotterdam Harbour and Industry Complex in the Netherlands and in the application of renewable energy in the &amp;Ouml;sterg&amp;ouml;tland region in Sweden.\\nThe objective of this article is to discuss the similarities and differences between the planned industrial symbiosis activities in Rotterdam and the unplanned biomass and industrial symbiosis activities in the &amp;Ouml;sterg&amp;ouml;tland region.

The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry. &amp;copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In Jinqiao EIP, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, an industrial symbiosis, based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil, was proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP. It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel. For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used and different scenarios were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Human toxicity air (HTA) and Total Environmental Impact Potential (TEIP) of the system. Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14%, the proposed industrial symbiosis has the least environmental impact.

It has become important for EIPs to quantitatively evaluate the CE performance of the production chain while also seeking specific measures that could promote resources utilization efficiency. In this paper, we combine the substance flow analysis (SFA) approach with the resource productivity (RP) indicator to evaluate the contribution of IS to the development of circular economy. Through questionnaires and field surveys of key enterprises in Suzhou New District (SND), a substance flow analysis and resource productivity indicator were developed for core materials (copper, water and energy) in printed circuit boards (PCB) production under the excluding waste utilization scenario and including waste utilization scenario. The results show that the RPCu of chain from electrolytic copper production enterprises (ECPE) to electrolytic copper foil production enterprises is respectively 21.38 and 23.15 thousand yuan per ton, from ECPE to copper clad laminate (CCL) production enterprises is respectively 64.15 and 71.32 thousand yuan per ton, and from ECPE to PCB production enterprises is respectively 176.47and 211.21 thousand yuan per ton under the two scenarios. RP is enhanced by prolonging the industrial production chain and the RP under the excluding waste utilization scenario is higher than the including waste utilization scenario for the same chain, which can be achieved through greater IS. Finally we propose further implications on developing CE in EIPs. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Harnessing coal, oil and gas, the energy resources contained in the store of our spaceship, Earth, has prompted a dramatic expansion in energy use and a substantial improvement in the quality of life of billions of individuals in some regions of the world. Powering our civilization with fossil fuels has been very convenient, but now we know that it entails severe consequences. We treat fossil fuels as a resource that anyone anywhere can extract and use in any fashion, and Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans as a dump for their waste products, including more than 30 Gt/y of carbon dioxide. At present, environmental legacy rather than consistence of exploitable reserves, is the most dramatic problem posed by the relentless increase of fossil fuel global demand. Harmful effects on the environment and human health, usually not incorporated into the pricing of fossil fuels, include immediate and short-term impacts related to their discovery, extraction, transportation, distribution, and burning as well as climate change that are spread over time to future generations or over space to the entire planet. In this essay, several aspects of the fossil fuel legacy are discussed, such as alteration of the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide rise and its measurement, greenhouse effect, anthropogenic climate change, air pollution and human health, geoengineering proposals, land and water degradation, economic problems, indirect effects on the society, and the urgent need of regulatory efforts and related actions to promote a gradual transition out of the fossil fuel era. While manufacturing sustainable solar fuels appears to be a longer-time perspective, alternatives energy sources already exist that have the potential to replace fossil fuels as feedstocks for electricity production.","collectionName":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"eef81e67-b1e1-35fc-af22-9e4fb2361d05","title":"Oil shale and climate policy in the shift to a low carbon and more resilient economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/oil-shale-climate-policy-shift-low-carbon-more-resilient-economy/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/oil-shale-climate-policy-shift-low-carbon-more-resilient-economy/","creator":"D.

At the same time, investors are carefully evaluating the profitability of unconventional fossil fuels such as shale oil. To enhance the understanding of the impacts of a climate policy such as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, on oil shale production - and vice versa - we have customized an integrated assessment model, the Climate and Energy Assessment for Resiliency model for Unconventional Fossil Fuels to the U.S. Western Energy Corridor. Our analysis indicates that while the bill would increase the production cost of oil shale, the industry remains highly profitable in the longer-term, generating a potential profit of about $10 to $16 billion per year by 2040 at 2.5. million barrels per day. These results suggest that the oil shale industry may comfortably face the enactment of a carbon policy, albeit with some caveats. Furthermore, while its potential economic impact on non-compliant industries may be severe, it would generate mounting profits for those achieving energy efficiency gains, thereby increasing the profitability of energy efficiency investments. ?? 2013.","collectionName":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"7bd1936b-4154-34d3-a293-da44f31b2951","title":"Depletion of fossil fuels and anthropogenic climate change-A review","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/depletion-fossil-fuels-anthropogenic-climate-changea-review/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/depletion-fossil-fuels-anthropogenic-climate-changea-review/","creator":"Mikael H&amp;ouml;&amp;ouml;k, Xu Tang","description":"Future scenarios with significant anthropogenic climate change also display large increases in world production of fossil fuels, the principal CO2 emission source. Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse.

Womack, Daniel T. Jones","description":"During the past 20 years, the real price of most consumer goods has fallen worldwide, the variety of goods and the range of sales channels offering them have continued to grow, and product quality has steadily improved. So why is consumption often so frustrating? It doesn't have to be--and shouldn't be--the authors say. They argue that it's time to apply lean thinking to the processes of consumption--to give consumers the full value they want from goods and services with the greatest efficiency and the least pain. Companies may think they save time and money by off-loading work to the consumer but, in fact, the opposite is true. By streamlining their systems for providing goods and services, and by making it easier for customers to buy and use those products and services, a growing number of companies are actually lowering costs while saving everyone time. In the process, these businesses are learning more about their customers, strengthening consumer loyalty, and attracting new customers who are defecting from less user-friendly competitors. The challenge lies with the retailers, service providers, manufacturers, and suppliers that are not used to looking at total cost from the standpoint of the consumer and even less accustomed to working with customers to optimize the consumption process. Lean consumption requires a fundamental shift in the way companies think about the relationship between provision and consumption, and the role their customers play in these processes. It also requires consumers to change the nature of their relationships with the companies they patronize. Lean production has clearly triumphed over similar obstacles in recent years to become the dominant global manufacturing model. Lean consumption, its logical companion, can't be far behind.","collectionName":"Harvard Business Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"2b7259a7-c5b5-31ae-8db4-eef62f373ff1","title":"An econometrics view of worldwide fossil fuel consumption and the role of US","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/econometrics-view-worldwide-fossil-fuel-consumption-role/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/econometrics-view-worldwide-fossil-fuel-consumption-role/","creator":"Shahriar Shafiee, Erkan Topal","description":"Crude oil, coal and gas, known as fossil fuels, play a crucial role in the global economy. This paper proposes new econometrics modelling to demonstrate the trend of fossil fuels consumption. The main variables affecting consumption trends are: world reserves, the price of fossil fuels, US production and US net imports. All variables have been analysed individually for more than half a century. The research found that while the consumption of fossil fuels worldwide has increased trends in the US production and net imports have been dependent on the type of fossil fuels. Most of the US coal and gas production has been for domestic use, which is why it does not have a strong influence on worldwide fossil fuel prices. Moreover, the reserves of fossil fuels have not shown any diminution during the last couple of decades and predictions that they were about to run out are not substantiated. The nominal and real price of fossil fuels was found to change depending on the type. Finally, estimates of three econometric models for the consumption of fossil fuels from 1949 to 2006 are presented which identify the effects of significant variables.

Carbon dioxide is by far the largest of these by volume, representing about 80% of the total emissions of these six gases. Almost all carbon dioxide is emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels and OECD countries account for over half of the total carbon dioxide emission in the world while an additional four countries (Brazil, China, India and Russia) together account for a further quarter of the global total. Many policies designed to reduce these emissions set emission reduction goals based on some previous level (e.g. 1990 in the case of Kyoto for many countries) which is used as a benchmark for success and compliance to the protocol. But changes in emissions at the national level can occur for many reasons: including the relocation of production abroad, and/or by import substitution. This may have a negligible impact on global emissions but, if the imports use more GHG intensive production processes than the domestically produced goods that they displace, global emissions could well be higher. The objective of this paper is to explore the role of trade in goods in this context by creating an indicator that estimates CO2 emissions related to domestic demand, for 24 countries (responsible for 80% of global CO2 emissions), as a complement to the more common indicator of emissions associated with domestic production of emissions, such as that used in the Kyoto Protocol. Using conservative assumptions the paper shows that estimates of CO2 emissions generated to satisfy domestic demand in the OECD in 1995 were 5% higher than emissions related to production. To put this figure into perspective only six countries in the world directly emitted more CO2 in 1995.","collectionName":"Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2003","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"15160706-d598-3caf-be3c-cd5d0fa5233e","title":"The role of bio-fuels in satisfying US transportation fuel demands","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-biofuels-satisfying-transportation-fuel-demands/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-biofuels-satisfying-transportation-fuel-demands/","creator":"Berk Akinci, Paul G.

In this paper, the production capacities for bio-fuels-ethanol and biodiesel-are evaluated for their potential impact on the US energy market. Several ramifications of these technologies are reviewed. This study concludes that ethanol or biodiesel production do not appear scalable to make a significant difference on the US fossil fuel demand for transportation.

By looking into a limited number of attempts at substitution and restoration of ecosystem services (e.g. artificial reefs, aquaculture in mangroves, artificial seawalls), we address the questions: (1) To what degree can technologies substitute for ecosystem services in the seascape? (2) How can ecosystem restoration reestablish not only the functions of direct value to humans, but also the ability of the systems to cope with future disturbance? Substitutions often imply the replacement of a function provided free by a solar powered, self-repairing resilient ecosystem, with a fossil-fuel-powered, expensive, artificial substitute that needs maintenance. Further, restoration usually does not focus on large-scale processes such as the physical, biological and biogeochemical interactions between mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs. Nonetheless, restoration might be the only viable management alternative when the system is essentially locked into an undesired community state (stability domain) after a phase-shift. We conclude that ecosystem services cannot be readily replaced, restored or sustained without extensive knowledge of the dynamics, multifunctionality and interconnectedness of ecosystems. &amp;copy; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Much attention has been focused on the CO(2) directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO(2) emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO(2) emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO(2) emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23% of global CO(2) emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO(2), were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, &amp;gt;30% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of &amp;gt;4 tons CO(2) per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO(2) per person. In contrast, 22.5% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO(2) emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"06c9eadf-eeb9-3cab-bc59-b5af7e5d3cee","title":"Hydrogen as a renewable and sustainable solution in reducing global fossil fuel consumption","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/hydrogen-renewable-sustainable-solution-reducing-global-fossil-fuel-consumption/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/hydrogen-renewable-sustainable-solution-reducing-global-fossil-fuel-consumption/","creator":"Adnan Midilli, Ibrahim Dincer","description":"In this paper, hydrogen is considered as a renewable and sustainable solution for reducing global fossil fuel consumption and combating global warming and studied exergetically through a parametric performance analysis. The environmental impact results are then compared with the ones obtained for fossil fuels. In this regard, some exergetic expressions are derived depending primarily upon the exergetic utilization ratios of fossil fuels and hydrogen: the fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency, fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator. These relations incorporate predicted exergetic utilization ratios for hydrogen energy from non-fossil fuel resources such as water, etc., and are used to investigate whether or not exergetic utilization of hydrogen can significantly reduce the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient (ranging from 1 to +&amp;infin;) indicating the fossil fuel consumption and contribute to increase the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating the hydrogen utilization at a certain ratio of fossil fuel utilization. In order to verify all these exergetic expressions, the actual fossil fuel consumption and production data are taken from the literature. Due to the unavailability of appropriate hydrogen data for analysis, it is assumed that the utilization ratios of hydrogen are ranged between 0 and 1. For the verification of these parameters, the variations of fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator as the functions of fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency and exergetic utilization of hydrogen from non-fossil fuels are analyzed and discussed in detail. Consequently, if exergetic utilization ratio of hydrogen from non-fossil fuel sources at a certain exergetic utilization ratio of fossil fuels increases, the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient will decrease and the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator will increase. &amp;copy; 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","collectionName":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"df56573d-b504-34af-a213-8d753740a5c9","title":"Do alternative energy sources displace fossil fuels?","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/alternative-energy-sources-displace-fossilfuels/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/alternative-energy-sources-displace-fossilfuels/","creator":"Richard York","description":"A fundamental, generally implicit, assumption of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and many energy analysts is that each unit of energy supplied by non-fossil-fuel sources takes the place of a unit of energy supplied by fossil-fuel sources.

Here, I show that the average pattern across most nations of the world over the past fifty years is one where each unit of total national energy use from non-fossil-fuel sources displaced less than one-quarter of a unit of fossil-fuel energy use and, focusing specifically on electricity, each unit of electricity generated by non-fossil-fuel sources displaced less than one-tenth of a unit of fossil-fuel-generated electricity. These results challenge conventional thinking in that they indicate that suppressing the use of fossil fuel will require changes other than simply technical ones such as expanding non-fossil-fuel energy production.","collectionName":"Nature Climate Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"697746ae-9d9c-3c52-9613-eaf875f2f18a","title":"Ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-goods-services-coral-reef-ecosystems-5/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-goods-services-coral-reef-ecosystems-5/","creator":"Fredrik Moberg, Carl Folke","description":"This article identifies ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems, with special emphasis on how they are generated.

Despite sustained attention to distributional conflicts between international capital and energy rich nation-states, few historical-materialists have paid attention to the relations between fossil fuel and capital accumulation in industrial capitalist societies. In opposition to ecological economic notions of fixed thermodynamic \"laws\", I first propose a dialectical conception of energy as embedded in dynamic social processes and power relations. Second, I review the historical importance of the energy shift from solar or biological sources of energy (muscles, wind, and water) to fossilized sources of energy (coal, oil, and gas). I then demonstrate how attention to fossil fuel energy forces a reexamination of the core insights of ecological Marxism and the political economy of nature. In the core argument of the paper, I reconsider the shift from biological to fossil energy as internal to the generalization and extension of capitalist social relations from two basic vantage points - (1) capitalist production based on wage labor; (2) the spatial conditions of capitalist circulation. I conclude by asking whether it is accurate to conceptualize capitalism as a \"fossil fuel mode of production\" and highlight the political urgency of a historical materialist perspective that takes seriously the importance of energy to the reproduction of capitalist social relations. ?? 2008.","collectionName":"Geoforum","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"feb41083-7ff9-3b46-a512-10914cdf65e3","title":"Integrated energy, environmental and financial analysis of ethanol production from cellulosic switchgrass","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/integrated-energy-environmental-financial-analysis-ethanol-production-cellulosic-switchgrass/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/integrated-energy-environmental-financial-analysis-ethanol-production-cellulosic-switchgrass/","creator":"Erika Felix, David R.

We used emergy accounting to integrate the ultimate amount of environmental, fossil fuel, and human-derived energy required to produce ethanol from switchgrass. Emergy is the total amount of energy of one form required directly and indirectly to make another form of energy. Forty-four percent of required emergy came from the environment either directly or embodied in purchased goods, 30% came from fossil fuels either directly or embodied in purchased goods, and 25% came from human-derived services indirectly.

At least 75% of total emergy was from non-renewable sources. Energy 'hidden' in indirect paths such as goods and services was 65% of the total.

In ISO standards 14040 and 14044 the capital goods are explicitly part of the product system. Thus, it is doubtful if capital goods can be excluded per se as has been done in quite a number of case studies and LCA databases. There is yet no clear idea about if and when capital goods play an important role in life cycle assessments. The present paper evaluates the contribution of capital goods in a large number and variety of product and service systems. A classification of product and service groups is proposed to give better guidance on when and where capital goods should be included or can be neglected. \nMethods. \nThe life cycle inventory database ecoinvent data v1.2 forms the basis for the assessment of the environmental importance of capital goods. The importance is assessed on the basis of several hundreds of cradle-to-gate LCAs of heat and electricity supply systems, of materials extraction and production, of agricultural products, and of transport and waste management services. The importance within product (and service) groups is evaluated with statistical methods by comparing the LCA results including and excluding capital goods. The assessment is based on characterised cumulative LCI results using the CML baseline characterisation factors of the impact categories of global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh- water acquatic toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, ionising radiation, and land competition, based on proxy indicators (fossil and nuclear) cumulative energy demand, and based on the end- point indicators Eco-indicator 99 (H,A) mineral resources, human health, eco system quality and totals. \nResults. \nThe analysis confirms the fact that capital goods cannot be excluded per se. On one hand, toxicity related environmental impacts such as freshwater ecotoxicity or human toxicity are more sensitive towards an inclusion or exclusion of capital goods. On the other, certain products like photovoltaic and wind electricity are very much or even completely affected by capital goods contributions, no matter which indicator is chosen. Nuclear electricity, agricultural products and processes, and transport services often behave differently (showing a higher or lower share of capital goods contribution) than products from other sectors. \nDiscussions. \nSome indicators analysed in this paper show a rather similar behaviour across all sectors analysed. This is particularly true for 'mineral resources', and - to a lesser extent -; for 'Eco- indicator 99 total', 'acidification' and 'climate change'. On the other hand, 'land use' and 'freshwater ecotoxicity' show the most contrasting behaviour with shares of capital goods' impacts between less than 1% and more than 98%. \nRecommendations. \nCapital goods must be included in the assessment of climate change impacts of non-fossil electricity, agricultural products and processes, transport services and waste management services. They must be included in any sector regarding the assessment of toxic effects. Energy analyses (quantifying the non-renewable cumulative energy demand) of agricultural products and processes, of wooden products and of transport services should include capital goods as well. The mixing of datasets including and excluding capital goods is no problem as long as their share on total impacts is low and partial omissions do not lead to a significant imbalance in comparative assertions. \nPerspectives. \nIf in doubt whether or not to include capital goods, it is recommended to check two things: (1) whether maintenance and depreciation costs of capital equipment form a substantial part of the product price (Heijungs et al. 1992a), and (2) whether actual environmental hot spots occur along the capital goods' supply chain.","collectionName":"International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"1854abfc-1fee-3ca1-a37f-4fc8bc13a700","title":"Peak oil demand: The role of fuel efficiency and alternative fuels in a global oil production decline","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/peak-oil-demand-role-fuel-efficiency-alternative-fuels-global-oil-production-decline/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/peak-oil-demand-role-fuel-efficiency-alternative-fuels-global-oil-production-decline/","creator":"Adam R.

The scenarios were evaluated using hybrid lifecycle assessment developed in a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework. In the hybrid MRIO LCA framework, technology-specific processes in the biofuels and fossil fuels LCA systems are integrated into a generalised 2-region (UK and Rest of the World) environmental-economic input-output framework in order to account for economy-wide indirect GHG emissions in the biofuels and fossil fuels LCA systems in addition to other indirect impacts such as indirect land use change. The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel (soybean, palm, rape, waste cooking oil) and bio-ethanol (sugarcane, sugarbeet, corn) were assessed and compared to fossil fuel (diesel and petrol) baseline. From one of the scenarios, biodiesel production from waste cooking oil and bioethanol from sugarbeet offer the biggest potential for emissions savings relative to fossil fuel equivalent and offering a maximum emission savings of 4.1% observed with a biofuel market share of 10% reached in 2020. It was also established that under current biofuel feedstock mix, to achieve the 6% emissions saving primarily from biofuels as proposed in the LCTP, 23.8% of the transport fuels market would be required to be held by biofuels by 2020. &amp;copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Local co-operation in industrial symbioses can reduce raw material use and waste disposal, but material and energy flows extending outside symbiosis boundaries can cause considerable environmental impacts. These external impacts are often ignored in industrial symbiosis studies. In this study, we compared process, hybrid and input-output life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in quantifying the overall environmental impacts of a forest industrial symbiosis, situated in Kymenlaakso, Finland. Conclusions from an earlier process-LCA were strengthened by the use of hybrid-LCA as local emissions were found to cause less than half of the global impacts. In some impact categories, the whole impact was caused by supply chain emissions (land use, metal depletion and ozone depletion). The cutoff in process-LCA was found to be less than 25%, except in metal depletion and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Input-output LCA approximated hybrid-LCA results well in most impact categories, but seriously underestimated land use and overestimated terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the results we conclude, that input-output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.","collectionName":"Environmental Science and Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"960ee910-fe1a-3216-aebb-bd3342004cf5","title":"Improving the CO2 performance of cement, part III: the relevance of industrial symbiosis and how to measure its impact","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/improving-co2-performance-cement-part-iii-relevance-industrial-symbiosis-measure-impact/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/improving-co2-performance-cement-part-iii-relevance-industrial-symbiosis-measure-impact/","creator":"Jonas Ammenberg, Leenard Baas, Mats Eklund, Roozbeh Feiz, Anton Helgstrand, Richard Marshall","description":"Cement production contributes to extensive CO2 emissions. However, the climate impact can vary significantly between different production systems and different types of cement products. The market is dominated by ordinary Portland cement, which is based on primary raw materials and commonly associated with combustion of vast amounts of fossil fuels. Therefore, the production of Portland cement can be described as a rather linear process. But there are alternative options, for example, involving large amounts of industrial byproducts and renewable energy which are more cyclic and thus can be characterized as relatively \"synergistic\". The main purpose of this article is to study how relevant the leading ideas of industrial symbiosis are for the cement industry based on a quantitative comparison of the CO2 emissions from different cement production systems and products, both existing and hypothetical. This has been done by studying a group of three cement plants in Germany, denoted as Cluster West, and the production of cement clinker and three selected cement products. Based on this analysis and literature, it is discussed to what extent industrial symbiosis options can lead to reduced CO2 emissions, for Cluster West and the cement industry in general. Utilizing a simplified LCA model (\"cradle to gate\"), it was shown that the CO2 emissions from Cluster West declined by 45% over the period 1997-2009, per tonne of average cement. This was mainly due to a large share of blended cement, i.e., incorporation of byproducts from local industries as supplementary cementitious materials. For producers of Portland cement to radically reduce the climate impact it is necessary to engage with new actors and find fruitful cooperation regarding byproducts, renewable energy and waste heat. Such a development is very much in line with the key ideas of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, meaning that it appears highly relevant for the cement industry to move further in this direction. From a climate perspective, it is essential that actors influencing the cement market acknowledge the big difference between different types of cement, where an enlarged share of blended cement products (substituting clinker with byproducts such as slag and fly ash) offers a great scope for future reduction of CO2 emissions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pearce","description":"In order to stabilize the global climate, the world's governments must make significant commitments to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Exergy is a measure of the degree of disequilibrium between a substance and its environment. The relations between several measures of environmental impact potential and exergy are investigated by comparing current methods used to assess the environmental impact potential of waste emissions and the exergy associated with those emissions. A case study is presented, to highlight the information revealed using exergy, in which the measures of environmental impact potential considered are the Ontario Ministry of Environment's schedule of industrial air emission limits, and two methods of assessing the environmental costs for air emissions resulting from the combustion of three common fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas.","collectionName":"International Journal of Energy Research","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1999","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"14aed560-40ec-3161-a0a3-5622100b8323","title":"Evaluation of innovative municipal solid waste management through urban symbiosis: A case study of Kawasaki","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluation-innovative-municipal-solid-waste-management-through-urban-symbiosis-case-study-kawasaki-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluation-innovative-municipal-solid-waste-management-through-urban-symbiosis-case-study-kawasaki-1/","creator":"Yong Geng, Fujita Tsuyoshi, Xudong Chen","description":"Industrial symbiosis encourages the establishment of a broad eco-industrial network so that more synergy opportunities can be identified.

This paper investigated the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for energy generated from forest resources through pyrolysis-based processing. The GHG emissions of producing pyrolysis bio-oil (pyrolysis oil) from different forest resources were first investigated; logging residues collected from natural regeneration mixed hardwood stands, hybrid poplar cultivated and harvested from abandoned agricultural lands, short rotation forestry (SRF) willow plantations and waste wood available at the site of the pyrolysis plant. Effects of biomass transportation were investigated through a range of distances to a central pyrolysis facility through road transport by semi-truck. Pyrolysis oil is assumed to be converted to electrical power through co-combustion in conventional fossil fuels power plants, gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) and diesel generators. Life cycle GHG emissions were compared with power generated using fossil fuels and power generated using biomass direct combustion in a conventional Rankine power plant. Life cycle GHG savings of 77%-99% were estimated for power generation from pyrolysis oil combustion relative to fossil fuels combustion, depending on the biomass feedstock and combustion technologies used. Several scenario analyses were conducted to determine effects of pyrolysis oil transportation distance, N-fertilizer inputs to energy crop plantations, and assumed electricity mixes for pyrolysis oil production. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Renewable Energy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"}},{"id":"fbeb4a45-2d68-3d60-b3b9-cda4ec507ea4","title":"Global and regional drivers of accelerating CO2 emissions.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/global-regional-drivers-accelerating-co2-emissions/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/global-regional-drivers-accelerating-co2-emissions/","creator":"Michael R Raupach, Gregg Marland, Philippe Ciais, Corinne Le Qu&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;, Josep G Canadell, Gernot Klepper, Christopher B Field","description":"CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning and industrial processes have been accelerating at a global scale, with their growth rate increasing from 1.1% y(-1) for 1990-1999 to &amp;gt;3% y(-1) for 2000-2004. The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies, particularly China.

Papageorgiou, J. R. Barton, A. Karagiannidis","description":"Waste management activities contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions approximately by 4%. In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions. &amp;copy; 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

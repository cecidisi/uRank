In large databases where data is both large and seemingly random, mining and visualization help to find the trends found in such large sets. We shall look at the developments of data mining and visualization and what kind of application fields usage of such tools.

At each of these levels, there is a wealth of information that can inform inquiry - from statistical models, to metadata, to the researcher's own knowledge and expertise. Joining all this information together can be a challenge, and there are issues of scale to be combatted along the way. In this paper, we describe an approach to text analysis that addresses these challenges of scale and multiple information sources, using probabilistic topic models to structure exploration through multiple levels of inquiry in a way that fosters serendipitous discovery. In implementing this approach into a tool called Serendip, we incorporate topic model data and metadata into a highly reorderable matrix to expose corpus level trends; extend encodings of tagged text to illustrate probabilistic information at a passage level; and introduce a technique for visualizing individual word rankings, along with interaction techniques and new statistical methods to create links between different levels and information types. We describe example uses from both the humanities and visualization research that illustrate the benefits of our approach. View full abstract"

Asymmetrically large two-way contingency tables pose a problem for common visualization methods. The Contingency Wheel has been recently proposed as an interactive visual method to explore and analyze such tables. However, the scalability and readability of this method are limited when dealing with large and dense tables. In this paper we present Contingency Wheel++, new visual analytics methods that overcome these major shortcomings: (1) regarding automated methods, a measure of association based on Pearson's residuals alleviates the bias of the raw residuals originally used, (2) regarding visualization methods, a frequency-based abstraction of the visual elements eliminates overlapping and makes analyzing both positive and negative associations possible, and (3) regarding the interactive exploration environment, a multi-level overview+detail interface enables exploring individual data items that are aggregated in the visualization or in the table using coordinated views. We illustrate the applicability of these new methods with a use case and show how they enable discovering and analyzing nontrivial patterns and associations in large categorical data."

In order to manage this size of repository, it is often essential to structure the repository according to a thematic classification hierarchy. InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore such large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. The hierarchical structure is represented by recursive Voronoi subdivision of the available space. At each level, larger subcollections are assigned more space and related subcollections gravitate towards one another. Individual documents at each level of the hierarchy are represented by stars placed according to their similarity. Finally, InfoSky extracts and displays descriptors describing the essential theme of each subcollection at each level of the hierarchy."

While these data hide important knowledge for the optimization of location and mobility oriented infrastructures and services, by themselves they lack the necessary semantic embedding which would make fully automatic algorithmic analysis possible. At the same time, making the semantic link is easy for humans who however cannot deal well with massive amounts of data. In this paper, we argue that by using the right visual analytics tools for the analysis of massive collections of movement data, it is possible to effectively support human analysts in understanding movement behaviors and mobility patterns. We suggest a framework for analysis combining interactive visual displays, which are essential for supporting human perception, cognition, and reasoning, with database operations and computational methods, which are necessary for handling large amounts of data. We demonstrate the synergistic use of these techniques in case studies of two real datasets."

The approach aims at the lightweight construction of integrated, situational workspaces pervasively accessible and sharable through a variety of devices. Methods Based on a meta-design approach, we designed and implemented a platform that allows end users, not necessarily experts of technologies, to extract contents from heterogeneous sources and compose Personal Information Spaces (PISs) that satisfy their information needs. Specific emphasis is posed on the adoption of a composition paradigm that abstracts from technical details and can thus be used by non-technical users. Results The platform for service composition that supports the activity of the different involved stakeholders is described in details. Thanks to the separation of concerns on which the composition paradigm is based, the overall approach and its enabling platform are also amenable to customization with respect to the requirements of specific domains. Conclusion We present an approach where a composition platform enables the extraction of content from heterogeneous services and its integration into situational applications where content presentation is flexibly managed through different visual templates. We also discuss the advantages offered by this approach to the stakeholders of a specific community of users in the Cultural Heritage domain. Practice The developed prototypes were evaluated in laboratories and field studies: the former aimed at investigating the ease of use and the users satisfaction of the functionality and the user interface of the environment for domain customization, the latter aimed instead at observing real users (e.g., guides of an archeological park) in action, to assess the validity of the proposed composition paradigm as an EUD practice. Implications The user studies described in this paper provided hints for refining the prototypes, and laid the basis for future work related to the identification of design principles that can make service-based composition technologies in general more useful and usable for end users."

As a fundamental technique in software engineering, reengineering includes (a) reverse engineering the as-is system design, (b) identifying a set of transformations to the design, and (c) applying these transformations. While methods a) and c) are widely supported by existing tools, identifying possible transformations to improve architectural quality is not well supported and, therefore, becomes increasingly complex in aged and large software systems. In this paper we present a novel visual analysis and design tool to support software architects during reengineering tasks in identifying a given software's design and in visually planning quality-improving changes to its design. The tool eases estimating effort and change impact of a planned reengineering. A prototype implementation shows the proposed technique's feasibility. Three case studies conducted on industrial software systems demonstrate usage and scalability of our approach."

Standard text search is useful, but even if the search target is known it may not be possible to formulate an effective query. In addition, summarization is an important non-search task. We present Overview, an application for the systematic analysis of large document collections based on document clustering, visualization, and tagging. This work contributes to the small set of design studies which evaluate a visualization system “in the wild”, and we report on six case studies where Overview was voluntarily used by self-initiated journalists to produce published stories. We find that the frequently-used language of “exploring” a document collection is both too vague and too narrow to capture how journalists actually used our application. Our iterative process, including multiple rounds of deployment and observations of real world usage, led to a much more specific characterization of tasks. We analyze and justify the visual encoding and interaction techniques used in Overview’s design with respect to our final task abstractions, and propose generalizable lessons for visualization design methodology.

Additionally, experimental results can be expanded with database information to better analyze the investigated elements and processes in an overall context. Users also have the possibility to use graph theoretical approaches in VANESA to identify regulatory structures and significant actors within the modeled systems. These structures can then be further investigated in the Petri net environment of VANESA. It is platform-independent, free-of-charge, and available at http://vanesa.sf.net."

However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of the technique, especially in support of complex multidimensional cluster analysis."

This paper presents an integration of multi-focus and multi-level techniques that enable interactive, multi-step comparisons in node-link networks. We describe NetEx, a visualization tool that enables users to simultaneously explore different parts of a network and its thematic data, such as time series or conditional probability tables. NetEx, implemented as a Cytoscape plug-in, has been applied to the analysis of electrical power networks, Bayesian networks, and the Enron e-mail repository. In this paper we briefly discuss visualization and analysis of the Enron social network, but focus on data from an electrical power network. Specifically, we demonstrate how NetEx supports the analytical task of electrical power system fault diagnosis. Results from a user study with 25 subjects suggest that NetEx enables more accurate isolation of complex faults compared to an especially designed software tool. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T."

Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections. However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection. We present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time Scatter/Gather of arbitrarily large collections after near-linear time preprocessing. This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy. A modification of Scatter/Gather employing this scheme, and an example of its use over the Tipster collection are presented."

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval. We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm."

This research aimed to determine how meaningful information may be extracted from limited sensor data and transformed to provide clear visualization for the clinicians who must use and interact with the data and make judgments on the condition of patients. We ascertained that a number of insightful features related to habits and physical condition could be determined from usage and motion sensor data. Methods: Our approach to the design of the visualization follows User Centered Design, specifically, defining requirements, designing corresponding visualizations and finally evaluating results. This cycle was iterated three times. Results: The User Centered Design method was successfully employed to converge to a design that met the main objective of this study. The resulting visualizations of relevant features that were extracted from the sensor data were considered highly effective and intuitive to the clinicians and were considered suitable for monitoring the behavior patterns of patients. Conclusions: We observed important differences in the approach and attitude of the researchers and clinicians. Whereas the researchers would prefer to have as many features and information as possible in each visualization, the clinicians would prefer clarity and simplicity, often each visualization having only a single feature, with several visualizations per page. In addition, concepts considered intuitive to the researchers were not always to the clinicians. Keywords:"

Our system, FeatureLens1, visualizes a text collection at several levels of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns. The current implementation focuses on frequent itemsets of n-grams, as they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection. Users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing them within and across documents in the collection. This also permits users to identify the temporal evolution of usage such as increasing, decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns. The interface could be used to explore other text features as well. Initial studies suggest that FeatureLens helped a literary scholar and 8 users generate new hypotheses and interesting insights using 2 text collections. Categories"

VisGets provide the information seeker with visual overviews of Web resources and offer a way to visually filter the data. Our goal is to facilitate the construction of dynamic search queries that combine filters from more than one data dimension. We present a prototype information exploration system featuring three linked VisGets (temporal, spatial, and topical), and used it to visually explore news items from online RSS feeds."

Using these tag clouds, WordBridge can reveal relationships by representing not only entities and their connections, but also the nature of their relationship using representative keywords for nodes and edges. In this paper, we apply the technique to an interactive web-based visual analytics environment---Apropos---where a user can explore a text corpus using WordBridge. We validate the technique using several case studies based on document collections such as intelligence reports, co-authorship networks, and works of fiction."

As they share this knowledge integration challenge with many management contexts, we have examined the knowledge visualization practices of a leading regional police force (and of a military unit) in order to derive insights for corporate knowledge management. To do so, we have conducted on-site observations, focus groups, and interviews, as well as site-, document-, tool- and software- analyses within the police headquarters. As one main result of our empirical investigation, we find that the police force’s practice of hybrid (i.e., digital and physical) knowledge visualization offers a useful strategy for corporate knowledge management as well. We also show how organizations can apply this dual approach to making knowledge visible i.e., using sophisticated visualization software in combination with hands-on physical and permanently visible knowledge boards. We discuss how these two modalities can be combined to improve knowledge management and how this hybrid practice can be understood theoretically through the lens of boundary object theory. With this regard, we also extend boundary object theory by identifying nine dynamic qualities of collaborative visualizations."

The study of the ecology in sampled microbial populations generates high dimensional data sets. Although many analysis methods are available for examination of such data, a tailored tool was required to fulfill the need of interactivity and flexibility for microbiologists. In this paper, MicrobiVis is presented. It is a tool for visual exploration and interactive analysis of microbiomic populations. MicrobiVis has been designed in close collaboration with end users. It extends previous interactive systems for explorative dimensionality reduction by including a range of domain relevant features. It contributes a flexible and explorative dimensionality reduction as well as a visual and interactive environment for examination of data subsets. By combining information visualization and methods based on analytic tasks common in microbiology as a means for gaining newand relevant insights. The utility of MicrobiVis is demonstrated through a use case describing how a microbiologist may use the system for a visual analysis of a microbial data set. Its usability and potential is indicated through positive feedback from the current end users."

Introducing real-time visual analytics into such application areas promises a lot of benefits since the rate of new incoming information often exceeds human perceptual limits when displayed linearly in raw formats such as tex- tual lines and automatic aggregation often hides important details. This paper presents a system to tackle some of the visualization challenges when analyzing such dynamic event data streams. In particular, we introduce the Event Visual- izer, which is a loosely coupled modular system for collect- ing, processing, analyzing and visualizing dynamic real-time event data streams. Due to the variety of different analy- sis tasks the system provides an extensible framework with several interactive linked visualizations to focus on different aspects of the event data stream. Data streams with logging data from a computer network are used as a case study to demonstrate the advantages of visual exploration. Categories"

We use logic programming (LP) as the underlying computing machinery to encode the relations as rules and facts and compute with them. A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains."

Whether they are fighting crime, curing diseases, deciding what car to buy, or researching a new field, inevitably investigators will encounter text documents. Taking a visual analytics approach, we integrate multiple text analysis algorithms with a suite of interactive visualizations to provide a flexible and powerful environment that allows analysts to explore collections of documents while sensemaking. Our particular focus is on the process of integrating automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner. We illustrate this integration through two example scenarios: an academic researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a consumer exploring car reviews while pondering a purchase decision. Finally, we provide lessons learned toward the design and implementation of visual analytics systems for document exploration and understanding."

Previously developed techniques have focused on low-dimensional datasets (e.g., with less than 20 distinct event types). Real-world datasets are often far more complex. This paper describes DecisionFlow, a visual analysis technique designed to support the analysis of high-dimensional temporal event sequence data (e.g., thousands of event types). DecisionFlow combines a scalable and dynamic temporal event data structure with interactive multi-view visualizations and ad hoc statistical analytics. We provide a detailed review of our methods, and present the results from a 12-person user study. The study results demonstrate that DecisionFlow enables the quick and accurate completion of a range of sequence analysis tasks for datasets containing thousands of event types and millions of individual events."

Although work in this area has relied on either manu- ally recorded provenance (for example, user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (for example, clicks, drags and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize users' visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstrac- tion, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our lab's prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities. Information"

A common strategy in analyzing and visualizing large and heterogeneous data is dividing it into meaningful subsets. Interesting subsets can then be selected and the associated data and the relationships between the subsets visualized. However, neither the extraction and manipulation nor the comparison of subsets is well supported by state-of-the-art techniques. In this paper we present Domino, a novel multiform visualization technique for effectively representing subsets and the relationships between them. By providing comprehensive tools to arrange, combine, and extract subsets, Domino allows users to create both common visualization techniques and advanced visualizations tailored to specific use cases. In addition to the novel technique, we present an implementation that enables analysts to manage the wide range of options that our approach offers. Innovative interactive features such as placeholders and live previews support rapid creation of complex analysis setups. We introduce the technique and the implementation using a simple example and demonstrate scalability and effectiveness in a use case from the field of cancer genomics. Index"

                    "abstract": "Rankings are a popular and universal approach to structuring otherwise unorganized collections of items by computing a rank for each item based on the value of one or more of its attributes. This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp--a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time."

We present a system for analyzing high-frequency position-based soccer data at various levels of detail, allowing to interactively explore and analyze for movement features and game events. Our Visual Analytics method covers single-player, multi-player and event-based analytical views. Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results. We evaluate our approach by investigating real-world soccer matches and collecting additional expert feedback. Several use cases and findings illustrate the capabilities of our approach."

However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation. We have applied these methods to two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production. The results provide important new insights into the recurring patterns"

A common way to analyze the process data is by using flowcharts. Visual analysis of a largescale chart, however, is too complex. In this case study, we employ a novel visualization technique, called VisBiz. VisBiz reduces data complexity by automatically analyzing operational data and abstracting the most critical parameters that influence business process. The basic idea is to select the most relevant parameters and layout them on a triple-attributes circular graph based on their relationships and user domain knowledge. VizBiz transforms the attributes to nodes and the process flows to lines. VisBiz derives a new process flow matrix to link the process of multiple circular graphs as the analyst introduces more parameters for further analysis. The results of the real-world credit card fraud study show the significant advantages of this technique in finding fraud distribution patterns and root causes of frauds."

Our design builds upon familiar node-link network layouts to contribute techniques for exploring connectivity in large graph structures, supporting visual search and analysis, and automatically identifying and visualizing community structures. Both public installation and controlled studies of the system provide evidence of the system's usability, capacity for facilitating discovery, and potential for fun and engaged social activity."

We intro- duce Apolo, a system that uses a mixed-initiative approach combining visualization, rich user interaction and machine learningto guide the user to incrementally and interac- tively explore large network data and make sense of it. Apolo engages the user in bottom-up sensemaking to gradually build up an understanding over time by starting small, rather than starting big and drilling down. Apolo also helps users find relevant information by specifying exemplars, and then us- ing a machine learning method called Belief Propagation to infer which other nodes may be of interest. We evaluated Apolo with twelve participants in a between-subjects study, with the task being to find relevant new papers to update an existing survey paper. Using expert judges, participants using Apolo found significantly more relevant papers. Sub- jective feedback of Apolo was also very positive."

This paper describes the implementation of multiple coordinated views within the Media Watch on Climate Change, a domain-specific news aggregation portal available at www.ecoresearch.net/climate that combines a portfolio of semantic services with a visual information exploration and retrieval interface. The system builds contextualized information spaces by enriching the content repository with geospatial, semantic and temporal annotations, and by applying semi-automated ontology learning to create a controlled vocabulary for structuring the stored information. Portlets visualize the different dimensions of the contextualized information spaces, providing the user with multiple views on the latest news media coverage. Context information facilitates access to complex datasets and helps users navigate large repositories of Web documents. Currently, the system synchronizes information landscapes, domain ontologies, geographic maps, tag clouds and just-in-time information retrieval agents that suggest similar topics and nearby locations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Integrating existing visualization methods with innovative documentation technology can increase the quality of information in technical documents. We have developed dynamic and interactive documents that incorporate not only text but also the entire interactive data visualisation and navigation process. Authors can produce electronic documents that collaborate and share data, analysis, visualization parameters, information and insight while distributed over the Internet, using intuitive visual navigation techniques. Using multiple coordinated views in a dynamic document will further help the reader to explore complex, multivariate data and discover their relationships. Visual data navigation is provided through interactive 2D and 3D visualisation components based on scalable and customisable, multilayer component architecture with a small footprint suitable for Web distribution. A \"Viewer\" client-side plug-in, responsible for data interactivity and visualization, is distributed as freeware to allow free distribution of dynamic documents over any network."

                    "abstract": "The increasing complexity and volume of data mandate tighter integration between analytics and visualization. In this paper, I propose a pattern of integrating of computational and visual analytics techniques, called just-in-time (JIT) interactive analytics. JIT analytics is performed in real-time on data that users are interacting with to guide visual-analytic exploration. Fundamental to JIT analytics is enriching visualizations with annotations that describe semantics of visual features, thereby suggesting to users possible insights to examine further. To accomplish this, JIT analytics needs to 1) identify insights depicted as visual patterns such as clusters, outliers, and trends in visualizations and 2) determine the semantics of such features by considering not only attributes that are being visualized but also other attributes in data. In this paper, I describe the JIT interactive analytics pattern, along with a generic implementation for any type of visualization and data, and provide a particular implementation for point-based visualization of multivariate data. I argue that the pattern provides a useful user experience by elevating the cognitive level of interaction with data from pure perception of visual representations to understanding higher level semantics of data. As such, this supports users in building faster qualitative mental models and accelerating discovery. Furthermore, facilitating insight opens new research opportunities such as visual-analytic action recommendations, improved collaboration, and accessibility."

We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis.

Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies.

Multiple simulation runs or multiple measurements of the same physical quantity result in ensem- bles of curves which we call families of curves. The analysis of time-series data is extensively studied in mathematics, statistics, and visualization; but less research is focused on the analysis of families of curves. Interactive visual analysis in combination with a complex data model, which supports families of curves in addition to scalar parameters, repre- sents a premium methodology for such an analysis. In this paper we describe the three levels of complexity of interac- tive visual analysis we identified during several case studies. The first two levels represent the current state of the art. The newly introduced third level makes extracting deeply hidden implicit information from complex data sets possi- ble by adding data derivation and advanced interaction. We seamlessly integrate data derivation and advanced interac- tion into the visual exploration to facilitate an in-depth in- teractive visual analysis of families of curves. We illustrate the proposed approach with typical analysis patterns iden- tified in two case studies from automotive industry. Categories"

However, clinical adoption of CBIR is partially hindered by the difference between the computed image similarity and the user's search intent, the semantic gap, with the end result that relevant images with outlier features may not be retrieved. Furthermore, most CBIR algorithms do not provide intuitive explanations as to why the retrieved images were considered similar to the query (e.g., which subset of features were similar), hence it is difficult for users to verify if relevant images, with a small subset of outlier features, were missed. Users therefore resort to examining irrelevant images and there are limited opportunities to discover these 'missed' images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to medical CBIR by enabling a guided visual exploration of the search space through a tool, called Visual Analytics for Medical Image Retrieval (VAMIR). The visual analytics approach facilitates interactive exploration of the entire dataset using the query image as a point-of-reference. We conducted a user study and several case studies to demonstrate the capabilities of VAMIR in the retrieval of CT images and multi-modality PET-CT images."

This paper describes the ViziMine cooperative data mining tool that acts as a personal assistant, assisting domain experts to explore and increase their expertise regarding a problem domain. The tool provides a uniform interface that incorporates a number of data mining tools that express their knowledge as rules.

Typical sources of such data are experiments in biology, physics or engineering, which are conducted in different configurations and use replicates to ensure statistically significant results. One common way to analyze this data is to filter it using statistical methods and then run clustering algorithms to group similar values. The clustering results can be visualized using heat maps, which show differences between groups as changes in color. However, in cases where groups of dimensions have an a priori meaning, it is not desirable to cluster all dimensions combined, since a clustering algorithm can fragment continuous blocks of records. Furthermore, identifying relevant elements in heat maps becomes more difficult as the number of dimensions increases. To aid in such situations, we have developed Matchmaker, a visualization technique that allows researchers to arbitrarily arrange and compare multiple groups of dimensions at the same time. We create separate groups of dimensions which can be clustered individually, and place them in an arrangement of heat maps reminiscent of parallel coordinates. To identify relations, we render bundled curves and ribbons between related records in different groups. We then allow interactive drill-downs using enlarged detail views of the data, which enable in-depth comparisons of clusters between groups. To reduce visual clutter, we minimize crossings between the views. This paper concludes with two case studies. The first demonstrates the value of our technique for the comparison of clustering algorithms. In the second, biologists use our system to investigate why certain strains of mice develop liver disease while others remain healthy, informally showing the efficacy of our system when analyzing multidimensional data containing distinct groups of dimensions."

Since there are no tools supporting this process, much of this work is done using ad-hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefficient and limits visual exploration of the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill-down features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the configuration of viewing parameters in such a multi-dataset, multi-view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and configuration interface for dataset dependencies and data-view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain experts. We describe case studies that illustrate how investigators used the tool to explore subtypes in large datasets and demonstrate how they efficiently replicated findings from the literature and gained new insights into the data."

In essence, these inhomogeneities form the patterns in the data that researchers are trying to find and understand. Sophisticated statistical methods are available to reveal these patterns, however, the visualization of their outcomes is mostly still performed in a one-view-fits-all manner. In contrast, our novel visualization approach, VisBricks, acknowledges the inhomogeneity of the data and the need for different visualizations that suit the individual characteristics of the different data subsets. The overall visualization of the entire data set is patched together from smaller visualizations, there is one VisBrick for each cluster in each group of interdependent dimensions. Whereas the total impression of all VisBricks together gives a comprehensive high-level overview of the different groups of data, each VisBrick independently shows the details of the group of data it represents. State-of-the-art brushing and visual linking between all VisBricks furthermore allows the comparison of the groupings and the distribution of data items among them. In this paper, we introduce the VisBricks visualization concept, discuss its design rationale and implementation, and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a use case from the field of biomedicine."

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple in- stances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effectiveway. To achieve this we employ two differ- ent multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to per- form three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup."

Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal neuroimaging approaches and joint analysis strategies are crucial for accurate, reliable and individualized identification of brain ROIs. In this paper, we present a novel approach of visual analytics and its open-source software for ROI definition and brain network construction. By combining neuroscience knowledge and computational intelligence capabilities, visual analytics can generate accurate, reliable and individualized ROIs for brain networks via joint modeling of multimodal neuroimaging data and an intuitive and real-time visual analytics interface. Furthermore, it can be used as a functional ROI optimization and prediction solution when fMRI data is unavailable or inadequate. We have applied this approach to an operation span working memory fMRI/DTI dataset, a schizophrenia DTI/resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) dataset, and a mild cognitive impairment DTI/R-fMRI dataset, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of visual analytics. Our experimental results are encouraging."

Unlike existing work in visual text analytics, which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel text visualization metaphors, ours tightly integrates state-of-the-art text an- alytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this article, we present our work from two aspects. We first introduce an enhanced, LDA-based topic analysis technique that automatically derives a set of topics to summarize a collection of documents and their content evolution over time. To help users understand the complex summarization results produced by our topic analysis technique, we then present the design and development of a time-based visualization of the results. Furthermore, we provide users with a set of rich interaction tools that help them further interpret the visualized results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a result, our work offers three unique con- tributions. First, we present an enhanced topic modeling technique to provide users with a time-sensitive and more meaningful text summary. Second, we develop an effective visual metaphor to transform abstract and often complex text summarization results into a comprehensible visual representation. Third, we offer users flexible visual interaction tools as alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text sum- marization techniques. We have applied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows promise, especially in support of complex text analyses."

Sharing externalizations (recorded information such as notes) could increase awareness and assist with team communication and coordination. However, we currently know little about how to provide tool support for this sort of sharing. We explore how linked common work (LCW) can be employed within a ‘collaborative thinking space’, to facilitate synchronous collaborative sensemaking activities in Visual Analytics (VA). Collaborative thinking spaces provide an environment for analysts to record, organize, share and connect externalizations. Our tool, CLIP, extends earlier thinking spaces by integrating LCW features that reveal relationships between collaborators' findings. We conducted a user study comparing CLIP to a baseline version without LCW. Results demonstrated that LCW significantly improved analytic outcomes at a collaborative intelligence task. Groups using CLIP were also able to more effectively coordinate their work, and held more discussion of their findings and hypotheses. LCW enabled them to maintain awareness of each other's activities and findings and link those findings to their own work, preventing disruptive oral awareness notifications."

Our approach takes the dual of each mesh patch and generates \"stitching cells\" on the fly to fill the gaps between dual meshes. We demonstrate applications of our technique with data from Enzo, an AMR cosmological structure formation simulation code. We show ray-cast visualizations that include contributions from particle data (dark matter and stars, also output by Enzo) and gridded hydrodynamic data. We also show results from isosurface studies, including surfaces in regions where adjacent patches differ by more than one refinement level."

This paper describes a number of new attack graph visualization techniques, each having certain desirable properties and offering different perspectives for solving different kinds of problems. Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints. Overall, our techniques scale quadratically with the number of machines in the attack graph."

While the transportation community emphasizes developing standards for storing this incident data, little effort has been made to design appropriate visual analytics tools to explore the data, extract meaningful knowledge, and represent results. Analyzing these large multivariate geospatial datasets is a non-trivial task. A novel, web-based, visual analytics tool called ICE (incident cluster explorer) is proposed as an application that affords sophisticated yet user-friendly analysis of transportation incident datasets. Interactive maps, histograms, two-dimensional plots and parallel coordinates plots are four visualizations that are integrated together to allow users to simultaneously interact with and see relationships between multiple visualizations. Accompanied by a rich set of filters, users can create custom conditions to filter data and focus on a smaller dataset. Due to the multivariate nature of the data, a rank-by-feature framework has been expanded to quantify the strength of relationships between the different fields."

Biologists and chemists need to quickly explore and evaluate potentially effective yet safe compounds based on many datasets that are in relationship with each other. However, there is a lack of tools that support them in these processes. To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms."

This joint analysis, however, poses a significant challenge for visualization. Current techniques are either well suited to visualize large amounts of pathway node attributes, or to represent the topology of the pathway well, but do not accomplish both at the same time. To address this we introduce {enRoute}, a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the nodes of this extracted path right next to it. This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially heterogeneous data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of topology and node attributes. As this approach does not modify the layout of pathway maps, it is compatible with arbitrary graph layouts, including those of hand-crafted, image-based pathway maps. We demonstrate the technique in context of pathways from the {KEGG} and the Wikipathways databases. We apply experimental data from two public databases, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE)} and The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA)} that both contain a wide variety of genomic datasets for a large number of samples. In addition, we make use of a smaller dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma and common xenograft models. To verify the utility of {enRoute}, domain experts conducted two case studies where they explore data from the {CCLE} and the hepatocellular carcinoma datasets in the context of relevant pathways."

One such example is environmental monitoring data, which are often collected over time and at multiple locations, resulting in a geographically indexed multivariate time series. Financial data, although not necessarily containing a geographic component, present another source of high-volume multivariate time series data. We present the mvtsplot function which provides a method for visualizing multivariate time series data. We outline the basic design concepts and provide some examples of its usage by applying it to a database of ambient air pollution measurements in the United States and to a hypothetical portfolio of stocks."

Indeed, their simplicity in depicting connectedness backed by a mathematical formalism, make graphs an ideal metaphor to convey relatedness between entities irrespective of the domain. However, graphs pose several challenges for visual analysis. A large number of entities or a densely connected set quickly render the graph unreadable due to clutter. Typed relationships leading to multigraphs cannot clearly be represented in hierarchical layout or edge bundling, common clutter reduction techniques. We propose a novel approach to visual analysis of complex graphs based on two metaphors: semantic blossom and selective expansion. Instead of showing the whole graph, we display only a small representative subset of nodes, each with a compressed summary of relations in a semantic blossom. Users apply selective expansion to traverse the graph and discover the subset of interest. A preliminary evaluation showed that our approach is intuitive and useful for graph exploration and provided insightful ideas for future improvements."

TheWeb can be seen as one huge digital library offering a variety of very useful information for business analysts. INSYDER addresses these possibilities and offers power- ful retrieval and visualisation functionalities. The main focus during the development was on the usability of the system. Therefore, a variety of well-established visual- isation components were employed to support the user during the information-seeking process (e.g. visual query, result table, bar graph, segment view with tile bars, and scatterplot). Also, the retrieval aspects were developed with the goal of increasing the usability of the system(e.g. natural language search, content-based classification, rel- evance feedback). Extensive evaluations of the retrieval performance and the usability of the visualisation were conducted. The results of these evaluations offered many helpful insights into developing a new visual-information- seeking system called VisMeB. Keywords:"

Some may say that it is a ‘solved problem’, while others argue that we are only just scratching the surface of the subject. Considering merely the CMV conference series, it is clear to see that in the early years researchers were concerned with models and techniques, while in latter years authors presented more work on how to apply these ideas to different domains. It is our view that there is still much research to be done, but the subject is changing and developing as a tool for Visual Analytics. This paper pro- vides the ‘state of the art’ of CMV, it describes areas that should be developed further and looks at what the future may hold for Coordinated and Multiple Views."

We introduce a Visual Analytics system for supporting the analysis of large amounts of financial time-varying indicator data. A system, driven by the idea of extending standard technical chart analysis from one to two-dimensional indi- cator space, is developed. The system relies on an unsuper- vised clustering algorithm combined with an appropriately designed movement data visualization technique. Several analytical views on the full market and specific assets are offered for the user to navigate, to explore, and to analyze. The system includes automatic screening of the potentially large visualization space, preselecting possibly interesting candidate data views for presentation to the user. The sys- tem is applied to a large data set of time varying 2-D stock market data, demonstrating its effectiveness for visual anal- ysis of financial data. We expect the proposed techniques to"

Based on this decomposition, we derive a visual exploration approach that consists of a novel multi- level visualization, adjoined traditional spatial and temporal views, as well as of tailored exploration techniques for their concerted use. We exemplify the utility of this approach by case studies on election and poll data from Germany’s various administrative levels and different time spans"

The starting point for current Visual Analytics tools and workflows is usually the readily available data set. Rarely though, Visual Analytics goes beyond the data set and also incorporates the data generating processes that have led to the data in the first place into the analysis. And indeed, in many use case scenarios, this is hardly possible, as these processes cannot be captured as data to be ana- lyzed themselves. Yet for the applications, in which this is feasible, new opportunities and challenges open up. In this paper, we illustrate these opportunities and chal- lenges by our efforts to bring together Visual Analytics and stochastic simulation for cell biological applications. The integration of both is possible, as the data generating pro- cess runs in silico and can thus be captured and analyzed alongside the mere simulation result. For this, we present solutions and tools, which permit Visual Analytics on all stages of this particular data generating process – on the stages of the model, the experiment, the simulation runs, and a combination of all three.

Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes in- creasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose FacetScape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the FacetScape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space."

Researchers have developed many tools for this purpose, suggesting a need for formal methods to guide these tools' creation. Increased data demands on computing requires redesigning VA tools to consider performance and reliability in the context of analysis of exascale datasets. Furthermore, visual analysts need a way to document their analyses for reuse and results justification. A VA graph framework encapsulated in a graph algebra helps address these needs. Its atomic operators include selection and aggregation. The framework employs a visual operator and supports dynamic attributes of data to enable scalable visual exploration of data."

For example, people search many words via search engines like Google and Bing every day. Analysts are interested in both the absolute searching number for each word as well as their relative rankings. Both sets of statistics may change over time. For very large time series data with thousands of items, how to visually present ranking changes is an interesting challenge. In this paper, we propose RankExplorer, a novel visualization method based on ThemeRiver to reveal the ranking changes. Our method consists of four major components: 1) a segmentation method which partitions a large set of time series curves into a manageable number of ranking categories; 2) an extended ThemeRiver view with embedded color bars and changing glyphs to show the evolution of aggregation values related to each ranking category over time as well as the content changes in each ranking category; 3) a trend curve to show the degree of ranking changes over time; 4) rich user interactions to support interactive exploration of ranking changes. We have applied our method to some real time series data and the case studies demonstrate that our method can reveal the underlying patterns related to ranking changes which might otherwise be obscured in traditional visualizations."

As the number of documents and the corre- sponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine them more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents."

This paper presents an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enables an analyst to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest. Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic. The contributions of this paper include: a description of the progressive visual analytics paradigm; design goals for both the algorithms and visualizations in progressive visual analytics systems; an example progressive visual analytics system (Progressive Insights) for analyzing common patterns in a collection of event sequences; and an evaluation of Progressive Insights and the progressive visual analytics paradigm by clinical researchers analyzing electronic medical records."

Traditional information visualization techniques are often not sufficient to allow an in-depth visual data exploration process. Multiple view systems combined with linking & brushing are only one building block of a successful InfoVis system. In this paper we propose the incorporation of cheap and simple gaze-based interaction. We employ the tracking information not for selecting data (i.e. mouse interaction) but for an intelligent adaption of 2D and 3D visualizations. Derived from the focus+context paradigm, we call this gaze-focus. The proposed methods are demonstrated by means of three different visualizations."

Clustered heatmaps are the standard technique for visualizing one-way and two-way clustering results. In clustered heatmaps, rows and/or columns are reordered, resulting in a representation that shows the clusters as contiguous blocks. However, for biclustering results, where clusters can overlap, it is not possible to reorder the matrix in this way without duplicating rows and/or columns.\\n\\nRESULTS: We present Furby, an interactive visualization technique for analyzing biclustering results. Our contribution is twofold. First, the technique provides an overview of a biclustering result, showing the actual data that forms the individual clusters together with the information which rows and columns they share. Second, for fuzzy clustering results, the proposed technique additionally enables analysts to interactively set the thresholds that transform the fuzzy (soft) clustering into hard clusters that can then be investigated using heatmaps or bar charts. Changes in the membership value thresholds are immediately reflected in the visualization. We demonstrate the value of Furby by loading biclustering results applied to a multi-tissue dataset into the visualization.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed tool allows analysts to assess the overall quality of a biclustering result. Based on this high-level overview, analysts can then interactively explore the individual biclusters in detail. This novel way of handling fuzzy clustering results also supports analysts in finding the optimal thresholds that lead to the best clusters."

We target this challenge with a new model-driven design process that effectively codesigns aspects of data, view, analytics, and tasks. We achieve this by using the workflow of the analysis task as a trajectory through data, interactive views, and analytical processes. The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool. As an example for how to apply the comprehensive design approach, we present Stack'n'flip, a sample implementation which tightly integrates visualizations of the actual data with a map of available data sets, views, and tasks, thus capturing and communicating the analytical workflow through the required data sets."

When zoomed to fit a computer screen, the detailed structure and node labels of even a moderately-sized network (say, with 500 nodes) can become invisible or difficult to read. Still, the coarse network structure typically remains visible, and helps orient an analyst's zooming, scrolling, and panning operations. These operations are very useful when studying details and reading node labels, but in the process of zooming in on one network region, an analyst may lose track of details elsewhere. To address such problems, we present in this paper multi-focus and multi-window techniques that improve interactive exploration of networks. Based on an analyst's selection of focus nodes, our techniques partition and selectively zoom in on network details, including node labels, close to the focus nodes. Detailed data associated with the zoomed-in nodes can thus be more easily accessed and inspected. The approach enables a user to simultaneously focus on and analyze multiple node neighborhoods while keeping the full network structure in view. We demonstrate our technique by showing how it supports interactive debugging of a Bayesian network model of an electrical power system. In addition, we show that it can simplify visual analysis of an electrical power network as well as a medical Bayesian network. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T."

These represent patterns at three different levels of abstraction for a dataset having very fine granularity. Discovery of such temporal associations in a multivariate setting provides useful insights which results in a prediction and diagnostic capability for the domain. In this paper we present a methodology for efficiently discovering all frequent patterns in each dimension of the data using Suffix Trees; then clustering these substring patterns to construct equivalence classes of similar (approximately matching) patterns; and then searching for temporal dependencies among these equivalence classes using an efficient search algorithm. Modes of operation are then inferred as summarization of these temporal dependencies. Our method is generalizable, scalable, and can be adapted to provide robustness against noise, shifting, and scaling factors"

To support the visual exploration of graph structures, a high degree of interactivity is required as well. We present a fully implemented graph visualization system, called CGV (Coordinated Graph Visualization), whose particular emphasis is on interaction. The system incorporates several interactive views that address different aspects of graph visualization. To support different visualization tasks, view ensembles can be created dynamically with the help of a flexible docking framework. Several novel techniques, including enhanced dynamic filtering, graph lenses, and edge-based navigation are presented. The main graph canvas interactions are augmented with several visual cues, among which the infinite grid and the radar view are novel. CGV provides a history mechanism that allows for undo/redo of interaction. CGV is a general system with potential application in many scenarios. It has been designed as a dual-use system that can run as a stand-alone application or as an applet in a web browser. CGV has been used to evaluate graph clustering results, to navigate topological structures of neuronal systems, and to perform analysis of some time-varying graphs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd."

So far, little research has been done to enable user interaction with such systems as a basis to support exploration and control by end users. In this paper, we present our research on the use of information visualization techniques to interact with recommender systems. We investigated how information visualization can improve user understanding of the typically black-box rationale behind recommendations in order to increase their perceived relevance and meaning and to support exploration and user involvement in the recommendation process. Our study has been performed using TalkExplorer, an interactive visualization tool developed for attendees of academic conferences. The results of user studies performed at two conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces that integrate recommendation technology. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection both increase when users are able to explore and interrelate multiple entities -- i.e. items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags."

Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems."

The technique is designed specifically for graphs that are “multivariate,” i.e., where each node is associated with several attributes. Unlike visualizations which emphasize global graph topology, PivotGraph uses a simple grid-based approach to focus on the relationship between node attributes and connections. The interaction technique is derived from an analogy with methods seen in spreadsheet pivot tables and in online analytical processing (OLAP). Finally, several examples are presented in which PivotGraph was applied to real-world data sets."

The objective is to understand the reactive behavior of complex programs for the purpose of finding unusual and possibly abnormal behavior, locating defects in the code, and finding causes of failures. Based on execution traces a multi-level analysis and visualization approach is proposed where, on one side, the behavior is analyzed to exhibit recurring execution patterns and their similarities and differences at a higher level of abstraction and, on the other side, program behavior can be explored in detail for giving explanations and showing causes of failures. The approach has been implemented as a tool chain for the analysis of PLC control programs. We discuss the key ideas of the approach, the implementation in a tool chain for PLC programs, and preliminary results from a case study."

To evaluate the model, we implement a system prototype, known as GreenHornet, which allows our analysts to test the theory in practice, identify the technological and usage-related gaps in the model, and then adapt the new technology in their work space. The paper describes the implementation of GreenHornet and compares its strengths and weaknesses against the other prevailing models and tools."

In- formation providers such as journalists seek to bring order into their daily work when dealing with temporally distributed events and the network of entities, such as persons, organisations or locations, which are related to these events. In this paper we introduce a time-oriented graph visualisation approach which maps temporal information to visual properties such as size, transparency and position and, combined with advanced graph navigation fea- tures, facilitates the identification and exploration of temporal relationships. To evaluate our visualisation, we compiled a dataset of ~120.000 news articles from international press agencies including Reuters, CNN, Spiegel and Aljazeera. Results from an early pilot study show the potentials of our visualisation approach and its usefulness for analysing temporal relationships in large data sets."

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction."

In this paper, we present PivotSlice, an interactive visualization technique which provides efficient faceted browsing as well as flexible capabilities to discover data relationships. With the metaphor of direct manipulation, PivotSlice allows the user to visually and logically construct a series of dynamic queries over the data, based on a multi-focus and multi-scale tabular view that subdivides the entire dataset into several meaningful parts with customized semantics. PivotSlice further facilitates the visual exploration and sensemaking process through features including live search and integration of online data, graphical interaction histories and smoothly animated visual state transitions. We evaluated PivotSlice through a qualitative lab study with university researchers and report the findings from our observations and interviews. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PivotSlice using a scenario of exploring a repository of information visualization literature."

By directly manipulating the filtering tree, a dynamic visual representation of queries and filters in the facet space, users can simultaneously browse the focused timelines and their contexts at different levels of detail, which supports efficient navigation of multi-dimensional events data. Also presented is an initial evaluation of TimeSlice with two datasets - famous deceased people and US daily flight delays."

However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real-time."

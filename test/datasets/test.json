However, it is difficult to discover and visualize these motifs as their numbers increase, especially in large multivariate time series. To find frequent motifs, we use several temporal data mining and event encoding techniques to cluster and convert a multivariate time series to a sequence of events. Then we quantify the efficiency of the discovered motifs by linking them with a performance metric. To visualize frequent patterns in a large time series with potentially hundreds of nested motifs on a single display, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. Analysts can interactively optimize the degree of distortion and merging to get the best possible view. A specific motif (e.g., the most efficient or least efficient motif) can be quickly detected from a large time series for further investigation. We have applied these methods to two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production. The results provide important new insights into the recurring patterns."

The financial data analysis domain is a promising field for research and application of Visual Analytics technology, as it prototypi- cally involves the analysis of large data volumes in solving complex analysis tasks. We introduce a Visual Analytics system for supporting the analysis of large amounts of financial time-varying indicator data. A system, driven by the idea of extending standard technical chart analysis from one to two-dimensional indi- cator space, is developed. The system relies on an unsuper- vised clustering algorithm combined with an appropriately designed movement data visualization technique. Several analytical views on the full market and specific assets are offered for the user to navigate, to explore, and to analyze. The system includes automatic screening of the potentially large visualization space, preselecting possibly interesting candidate data views for presentation to the user. The sys- tem is applied to a large data set of time varying 2-D stock market data, demonstrating its effectiveness for visual anal- ysis of financial data. We expect the proposed techniques to be beneficial in other application areas as well."

However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real-time."

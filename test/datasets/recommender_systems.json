The task of top-N item recommendation is to predict a ranking of items (movies, books, songs, or products in general) that can be of interest for a user based on earlier preferences of the user. We focus on implicit feedback where preferences are given in the form of binary events/ratings. Differently from state-of-the-art methods, the method proposed is designed to optimize the AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. Specifically, this turns out in a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods in terms of AUC of the obtained predictions."

However, it has been recognized that accurate prediction of rating values is not the only requirement for achieving user satisfaction. One other requirement, which has gained importance recently, is the diversity of recommendation lists. Being able to recommend a diverse set of items is important for user satisfaction since it gives the user a richer set of items to choose from and increases the chance of discovering new items. In this study, we propose a novel method which can be used to give each user an option to adjust the diversity levels of their own recommendation lists. Experiments show that the method effectively increases the diversity levels of recommendation lists with little decrease in accuracy. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed method, while achieving similar diversification performance, has a very low computational time complexity, which makes it highly scalable and allows it to be used in the online phase of the recommendation process. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

We model the interaction of the contextual factors with item ratings introducing additional model parameters. The performed experiments show that the proposed solution provides comparable results to the best, state of the art, and more complex approaches. The proposed solution has the advantage of smaller computational cost and provides the possibility to represent at different granularities the interaction between context and items. We have exploited the proposed model in two recommendation applications: places of interest and music."

In user-to-user similarity the ratings assigned by two users to a set of items are pairwise compared and averaged (correlation). In this paper we make user-to-user similarity adaptive, i.e., we dynamically change the computation depending on the profiles of the compared users and the target item whose rating prediction is sought. We propose to base the similarity between two users only on the subset of co-rated items which best describes the taste of the users with respect to the target item. These are the items which have the highest correlation with the target item. We have evaluated the proposed method using a range of error measures and showed that the proposed locally adaptive neighbor selection, via item selection, can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared to standard CF."

B-Rank captures well the difference between popular and niche objects. The proposed algorithm produces very promising results for sparse and dense voting matrices. Furthermore, I introduce a recommendation list update algorithm to cope with new votes. This technique significantly reduces computational complexity. The algorithm implementation is simple, since B-Rank needs no parameter tuning."

Users of these services can an- notate their bookmarks by using informal tags and other metadata, such as titles, descriptions, etc. In this paper, we focus on the task of item recommendation for social bookmarking websites, i.e. pre- dicting which unseen bookmarks a user might like based on his or her profile. We examine how we can incorporate the tags and other metadata into a nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering (CF) algo- rithm, by replacing the traditional usage-based similarity metrics by tag overlap, and by fusing tag-based similarity with usage-based similarity. In addition, we perform experiments with content-based filtering by using the metadata content to recommend interesting items. We generate recommendations directly based on Kullback- Leibler divergence of the metadata language models, and we ex- plore the use of this metadata in calculating user and item simi- larities. We perform our experiments on three data sets from two different domains: Delicious, CiteULike and BibSonomy."

Although applications naturally serve for a special purpose, they cannot be addressed to a particular context of use. Hitherto, context information is not taken into account for the recommendation of mobile applications. In this paper we present work in progress on a platform that gives rise to context-awareness for mobile application recommendation. It records the users’ application usage and relates it to context informa- tion that is traced on the users’ devices. Thereby we can determine the context of use of the applications. We describe the conceptual design of a recommender system that exploits this information and suggests only contextual relevant applications to its users. A prototype implementation is presented."

The system employs hybrid techniques from traditional recommender system literature, in addition to a novel interactive interface which serves to explain the recom- mendation process and elicit preferences from the end user. We present an evaluation that compares different interactive and non-interactive hybrid strategies for computing recom- mendations across diverse social and semantic web APIs. Results of the study indicate that explanation and interac- tion with a visual representation of the hybrid system in- crease user satisfaction and relevance of predicted content."

This chapter surveys the space of two-part hybrid recommender systems, comparing four different recommendation techniques and seven different hybridization strategies. Implementations of 41 hybrids including some novel combinations are examined and compared. The study finds that cascade and augmented hybrids work well, especially when combining two components of differing strengths."

They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering."

In that field, collaborative filtering approaches can be distinguished from content-based ones. The former is based on a set of user ratings on items, while the latter uses item content descriptions and user thematic profiles. While collaborative filtering systems often result in better predictive performance, content-based filtering offers solutions to the limitations of collaborative filtering, as well as a natural way to interact with users. These complementary approaches thus motivate the design of hybrid systems. In this chapter, the main algorithmic methods used for recommender systems are presented in a state of the art. The evaluation of recommender systems is currently an important issue. The authors focus on two kinds of evaluations. The first one concerns the performance accuracy: several approaches are compared through experiments on two real movies rating datasets MovieLens and Netflix. The second concerns user satisfaction and for this a hybrid system is implemented and tested with real users."

The enormous growth of learning objects on the internet and the availability of preferences of usage by the community of users in the existing learning object repositories (LORs) have opened the possibility of testing the efficiency of CF algorithms on recommending learning materials to the users of these communities. In this paper we evaluated recommendations of learning resources generated by different well known memory-based CF algorithms using two databases (with implicit and explicit ratings) gathered from the popular MERLOT repository. We have also contrasted the results of the generated recommendations with several existing endorsement mechanisms of the repository to explore possible relations among them. Finally, the recommendations generated by the different algorithms were compared in order to evaluate whether or not they were overlapping. The results found here can be used as a starting point for future studies that account for the specific context of learning object repositories and the different aspects of preference in learning resource selection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding running routes, getting from A to B is less important than running on a route which meets specific requirements relevant to a runner. Map data is usually obtained for car routing problems. Data on running routes, particularly routes which are in remote areas, might only consist of GPS traces with no additional information such as terrain or lighting. In order to tackle these issues, running routes are considered as objects described with different attributes. As a result, recommendation of running routes becomes a multi-criteria decision making problem. We describe how this objects and their attributes can be obtained. We incorporate personalization by applying a location-based filtering mechanism to determine running routes in the vicinity of a user or a user-specified location. This selection is then sorted by an ontology supported ranking mechanism which evaluates route attributes in relation to a user profile, user context and collaborative features."

Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can ``intelligently'' determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions. The common solution, ``explicit ratings'', where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise. However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more ``intelligent'' method is to useimplicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user. These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating. Current recommender systems mostly do not use implicit ratings, nor is the ability of implicit ratings to predict actual user interest well-understood. This research studies the correlation between various implicit ratings and the explicit rating for a single Web page. A Web browser was developed to record the user's actions (implicit ratings) and the explicit rating of a page. Actions included mouse clicks, mouse movement, scrolling and elapsed time. This browser was used by over 80 people that browsed more than 2500 Web pages. Using the data collected by the browser, the individual implicit ratings and some combinations of implicit ratings were analyzed and compared with the explicit rating. We found that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling had a strong correlation with explicit interest, while individual scrolling methods and mouse-clicks were ineffective in predicting explicit interest."

This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top- N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recom- mender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accu- racy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non- personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, re- gardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other rec- ommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommenda- tion task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods."

In these types of applications, data to be clustered is in the form of user sessions which are sequences of web pages visited by the user. Sequence clustering is one of the important tools to work with this type of data. One way to represent sequence data is through weighted, undirected graphs where each sequence is a vertex and the pairwise similarities between the user sessions are the edges. Through this representation, the problem becomes equivalent to graph partitioning which is NP-complete and is best approached using multiple objectives. Hence it is suitable to use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) to solve it. The main focus of this paper is to determine an effective MOEA to cluster sequence data. Several existing approaches in literature are compared on sample data sets and the most suitable approach is determined. Copyright 2007 ACM."

User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be sev- eral millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user–item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations. In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item.

Through information visualization techniques, we can provide a dashboard for learners and teachers, so that they no longer need to \"drive blind\". Moreover, recommendation can help to deal with the \"paradox of choice\" and turn abundance from a problem into an asset for learning."

Visualizing recommendations can remove some of this mystery, showing how a recommendation is grouped with other choices. A drawing can also lead a user's eye to other options. Traditional 2D-embeddings of points can be used to create a basic layout, but these methods, by themselves, do not illustrate clusters and neighborhoods very well. In this paper, we propose the use of geographic maps to enhance the definition of clusters and neighborhoods, and consider the effectiveness of this approach in visualizing similarities and recommendations arising from TV shows and music selections.

This paper shows that a CF frmaework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinion of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone.It also show that using CF to create a personcal combination of a set of agents produce better results that either individual agents or other combination mechanisms.One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents, they can use them and let the CF framwork select the best ones for them"

This is in contrast to previous approaches which are either insensitive to user intent or require explicit, user specified task information. Our approach, called Behavior-Driven Visualization Recommendation (BDVR), consists of two distinct phases: (1) pattern detection, and (2) visualization recommendation. In the first phase, user behavior is analyzed dynamically to find semantically meaningful interaction patterns using a library of pattern definitions developed through observations of real-world visual analytic activity. In the second phase, our BDVR algorithm uses the detected patterns to infer a user's intended visual task. It then automatically suggests alternative visualizations that support the inferred visual task more directly than the user's current visualization. We present the details of BDVR and describe its implementation within our lab's prototype visual analysis system. We also present study results that demonstrate that our approach shortens task completion time and reduces error rates when compared to behavior-agnostic recommendation"

Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board. We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems. We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items."

Recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social media - people and tags. Relationship information among people, tags, and items, is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise. Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest."

The formation and decay of trust in recommendations is a dynamic process influenced by context, human preferences, accuracy of recommendations, and the interactions of these factors. This paper describes two psychological experiments (N=400) that evaluate the evolution of trust in recommendations over time, under personalized and non- personalized recommendations by matching or not matching a participant’s profile. Main findings include: Humans trust inaccurate recommendations more than they should; when recommendations are personalized, they lose trust in inaccurate recommendations faster than when recommendations are not personalized; and participants report less trust and lower overall ratings of personalized but inaccurate recommendations compared to not-personalized inaccurate recommendations. We make connections to the possible implications of these psychological findings to the design of recommender systems."

However, current recommender systems are black boxes, providing no transparency into the working of the recommendation. Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation. In this paper, we address explanation interfaces for ACF systems - how they should be implemented and why they should be implemented. To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process. We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some initial explorations into measuring how explanations can improve the filtering performance of users."

In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated."

The main goal of traditional collaborative filtering techniques is improvement of the accuracy of recommendation. Nevertheless, such techniques present the problem that they include many items that the user already knows. These recommendations appear to be good when we consider accuracy alone. On the other hand, when we consider users' satisfaction, they are not necessarily good because of the lack of discovery. In our work, we infer items that a user does not know by calculating the similarity of users or items based on information about what items users already know. We seek to recommend items that the user would probably like and does not know by combining the above method and the most popular method of collaborative filtering."

A complicated knowledge network of individuals, documents, data, concepts, and their interconnections forms a virtual knowledge repository. To be more effective in using these resources, knowledge discovery tools are crucial for an organization and individual users to identify the right expertise or knowledge resources from this large \"multidimensional network.\"  Cyberinfrastructure Knowledge Networks on the Web (CIKNOW) is a suite of Web-based tools that facilitates discovery of resources within communities. CI-KNOW implements a network recommendation system that incorporates social motivations for why we create, maintain, and dissolve our knowledge network ties. The network data is captured by automated harvesting of digital resources using Web crawlers, text miners, tagging tools that automatically generate community-oriented metadata, and scientometric data such as co-authorship and citations. Based on this knowledge network, the CI-KNOW recommender system produces personalized search results through two steps: identify matching entities according to their metadata and network statistics and select the best fits according to requester's perspectives and connections in social networks.  Integrated with community Web portals, CI-KNOW navigation and auditing portlets provide analysis and visualization tools for community members and serves as a research testbed to examine social theories on individuals' motivations for seeking expertise from specific resources (people, documents, datasets, and etc.). As a proof-of-concept, this paper demonstrates how CI-KNOW, integrated with the NCI-supported Tobacco Informatics Grid (TobIG), facilitates knowledge sharing in the tobacco control research community."

As tagging becomes common practice at many social media sites, this research proposes a new approach to user profiling based on the tags associated with one's personal collection of contents. To utilize the social interaction implied by tagging, a personal profile can be further extended with the tags specified by one's social contacts. A tag-to-tag matrix is defined to enable collaborative filtering-style recommendations without explicit user ratings. Experiments with collections of bookmarks and the associated tags from 42,463 users are presented and compared using the different views.

In this article we argue that the motivation of diversity research is to increase the probability of retrieving unusual or novel items which are relevant to the user and introduce a methodology to evaluate their performance in terms of novel item retrieval. Moreover, noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we formulate the trade-off between diversity and matching quality as a binary optimization problem, with an input control parameter allowing explicit tuning of this trade-off. We study solution strategies to the optimization problem and demonstrate the importance of the control parameter in obtaining desired system performance. The methods are evaluated for collaborative recommendation using two datasets and case-based recommendation using a synthetic dataset constructed from the public-domain Travel dataset."

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender."

One problem is that the user is often modelled as a passive source of rele- vance information, instead of an active entity trying to steer the system based on evolving information needs. This may cause the user to feel that the response of the system is in- consistent with her steering. Another problem arises due to the sheer size and complexity of the information space, and hence of the system, as it may be difficult for the user to an- ticipate the consequences of her actions in this complex en- vironment. These problems can be mitigated by interpreting the user’s actions as setting a goal for an optimization prob- lem regarding the system state, instead of passive relevance feedback, and by allowing the user to see the predicted ef- fects of an action before committing to it. In this paper, we present an implementation of these improvements in a visual user-controllable search interface. A user study involving ex- ploratory search for scientific literature gives some indication on improvements in task performance, usability, perceived usefulness and user acceptance. Author"

User-based Collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date, and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers that in typical commercial applications can grow to be several millions. To address these scalability concerns item-based recommendation techniques have been developed that analyze the user-item matrix to identify relations between the different items, and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations. In this paper we present one such class of item-based recommendation algorithms that first determine the similarities between the various ite..."

The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs."

                    "abstract": "A n increasing selection of content is becoming available in the mobile-Web envi- ronment,where users navigate the Web using wireless devices such as cell phones and PDAs. The fast growth and excellent prospects of the mobile-Web content market have attracted many content providers. However, as continuing deregulation further lowers the entry barriers for providers, increased competition is quickly eliminating profit opportuni- ties. To survive in this environment, providers must offer an intelligent system that provides customers with a more pleasant mobile-shopping experience. A particularly popular form of mobile-Web con- tent is wallpaper images for cell phones.1 Although the market for this content is growing rapidly as related technologies evolve, customers experience much frus- tration when searching for the images they want, owing to inefficient sequential search (see Figure 1). When a customer logs on to an image-download site using a cell phone, the site presents the customer with a list of the best-selling or newest images. The cus- tomer pages through the list and selects an image to inspect. If the customer likes the image, he or she might buy it. Otherwise, the customer repeats these steps until he or she stumbles over the right image or gives up. With this method, the expected number of images the customer views before hitting the desired image far exceeds the acceptable level. These difficulties are partly attributable to the cell phone’s characteristics. Compared to PCs, cell phones have smaller screens, fewer input keys, and less sophisticated browsers. So, the user interface of mobile-Web applications isn’t as friendly as that of typical Web applications. Consequently, many cus- tomers use their PCs to select images and then request a download to their mobile devices. Nevertheless, searching generally remains inconvenient and com- plex. To make searching more acceptable, a more efficient search aid that suggests only the images meet- ing the customer’s preference is necessary. As a solution to these problems, we propose VIS- CORS (Visual Contents Recommender System). To reduce customers’search effort,VISCORS combines the two most popular information-filtering techniques: collaborative filtering and content-based image retrieval. Combined, these techniques properly han- dle the distinct characteristics of visual content while taking into account the mobile Web’s constraints"

The semantic web is well recognized as an effective infrastructure to enhance visibility of knowledge on the web. The core of the semantic web is ontology, which is used to explicitly represent our conceptualizations. Since the information overload, recommendation systems are facing new challenges for effective recommendation. With semantic web technology, information can be given well-defined meaning which can be understood and processed by machines. It provides new possibilities for effective recommendation. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a recommendation mechanism based on the semantic web. In addition, this paper presents and discusses some experiments that are based on quantitative and qualitative evaluation"

                    "abstract": "Research on recommender systems typically focuses on the accuracy of prediction algorithms. Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems."

In this article, we review the key advances in collaborative filtering recommender systems, focusing on the evolution from research concentrated purely on algorithms to research concentrated on the rich set of questions around the user experience with the recommender. We show through examples that the embedding of the algorithm in the user experience dramatically affects the value to the user of the recommender. We argue that evaluating the user experience of a recommender requires a broader set of measures than have been commonly used, and suggest additional measures that have proven effective. Based on our analysis of the state of the field, we identify the most important open research problems, and outline key challenges slowing the advance of the state of the art, and in some cases limiting the relevance of research to real-world applications."

Collaborative filtering, the dominant algorithm underlying recommender systems, uses a model of its users, contained within profiles, in order to guide what interactions should be allowed, and how these interactions translate first into predicted ratings, and then into recommendations. In this chapter, the authors introduce the various approaches that have been adopted when designing collaborative filtering algorithms, and how they differ from one another in the way they make use of the available user information. They then explore how these systems are evaluated, and highlight a number of problems that prevent recommendations from being suitably computed, before looking at the how current trends in recommender system research are projecting towards future developments."

In this paper, we claim that each of them takes only one-directional information from the user-item ratings matrix to generate recommendations. In other words, the former combines user similarities and the latter tries to make a prediction by utilizing item similarities. We can observe the same appearance in the other CF area using binary user-item matrix in which transactions, i.e. purchase (1) or non-purchase (0), are marked. It means that we may use only half of the total information from the given data set. Completing the missing part of usable information we proposed a new prediction method, two-way cooperative CF which takes both vertical and horizontal information, in the ensemble respect. The proposed prediction scheme does not fix its CF technique but associates two predictions, which come from different CF algorithms, by weighted averaging. To decide fair weights the four cases, equivalent case, user-winning case, item-winning case, and prediction-impossible case are categorized by measuring the amount of information which each CF utilizes, or the degree of the reliability of a prediction model. We also embedded bagging in our prediction frame to make more accurate predictions. Numerical experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness to data sparseness based on both ratings and binary user-item matrix."

Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations."

The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature."

Content-based recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recom- mender consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to recommend to the user new interesting items. This chapter provides an overview of content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation. The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of content- based recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages and drawbacks. The second part of the chapter provides a review of the state of the art of systems adopted in several application domains, by thoroughly describ- ing both classical and advanced techniques for representing items and user profiles. The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered."

One way to build such a model is to ask the user to rate a selection of items. The choice of items selected affects the quality of the user model generated. In this paper, we explore the effects of letting the user participate in choosing the items that are used to develop the model. We compared three interfaces to elicit information from new users: having the system choose items for users to rate, asking the users to choose items themselves, and a mixed-initiative interface that combines the other two methods. We found that the two pure interfaces both produced accurate user models, but that directly asking users for items to rate increases user loyalty in the system. Ironically, this increased loyalty comes despite a lengthier signup process. The mixed-initiative interface is not a reasonable compromise as it created less accurate user models with no increase in loyalty."

Following a brief review of existing approaches to explanation in recommender systems, we focus in this paper on a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to product recommendation that offers important benefits in terms of the ease with which the recommendation process can be explained and the systems recommendations can be justified. For example, recommendations based on incomplete queries can be justified on the grounds that the users preferences with respect to attributes not mentioned in her query cannot affect the outcome. We also show how the relevance of any question the user is asked can be explained in terms of its ability to discriminate between competing cases, thus giving users a unique insight into the recommendation process."

In this paper, we present an elegant and effective framework for combining content and collaboration. Our approach uses a content-based predictor to enhance existing user data, and then provides personalized suggestions through collaborative filtering. We present experimental results that show how this approach, Content-Boosted Collaborative Filtering, performs better than a pure content-based predictor, pure collaborative filter, and a naive hybrid approach."

Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former."

The black-box nature of most CF applications leave the user wondering how the system arrived at its recommendation. This note introduces PeerChooser, a collaborative recommender system with an interactive graphical explanation interface. Users are provided with a visual explanation of the CF process and opportunity to manipulate their neighborhood at varying levels of granularity to reflect aspects of their current requirements. In this manner we overcome the problem of redundant profile information in CF systems, in addition to providing an explanation interface. Our layout algorithm produces an exact, noiseless graph representation of the underlying correlations between users. PeerChooser's prediction component uses this graph directly to yield the same results as the benchmark. User's then improve on these predictions by tweaking the graph to their current requirements. We present a user-survey in which PeerChooser compares favorably against a benchmark CF algorithm."

Traditional justification methods are based on textual explanations, which can be inadequate for analysis, comprehension, and decision making on the part of the user. In this paper, we present a method that generates tree graphs that contain the following information: the recommended items, the items that have appeared most often in the recommendation process, the relative importance of the items, and the relationships that exist among the items. The trees obtained in the experiments show (1) the greater novelty of user-to-user results, (2) the overspecialization inherent in the item-to-item approach, and (3) the equilibrium obtained by employing hybrid user-to-user/item-to-item collaborative filtering. The proposed method presents the possibility of extending recommendation result justifications to groups of users and facilitates the explanation of large numbers of recommended items."

In this paper, I survey visual approaches that go beyond presenting the recommended items as a textual list or as annotations in context. I also review related literature from recommendations’ explanations. In this thesis, I aim to understand how different visualizations and some personal traits might influence users’ assessment of recommended items, particularly in domains where multidimensional data or contextual constraints are involved. I present the prototype of 2 recommendation visualizations and then briefly propose the research approach of this investigation. Categories"

However, several studies have shown that accu- racy does not always correlate with a better user experience, leading to recent research that puts emphasis on Human- Computer Interaction in order to investigate aspects of the interface and user characteristics that influence the user expe- rience on recommender systems. Following this newresearch this paper presents SetFusion, a visual user-controllable inter- face for hybrid recommender system. Our approach enables users to manually fuse and control the importance of recom- mender strategies and to inspect the fusion results using an interactive Venn diagram visualization. We analyze the re- sults of two field studies in the context of a conference talk recommendation system, performed to investigate the effect of user controllability in a hybrid recommender. Behavioral analysis and subjective evaluation indicate that the proposed controllable interface had a positive effect on the user experi- ence."

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of social tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and evaluated two enhancements of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on Cite ULike, a social tagging service for scientific articles. The result obtained after two phases of evaluation suggests that both enhancements are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms, as we do in our NwCF approach, leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 similarity measure, an alternative to Pearson correlation for calculating the similarity between users and their neighbors, increases the coverage of the recommendation process."

Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to recommend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user."

We show the effectiveness of these principles via a significant-scale user study in which we compared an interface developed based on these principles with a traditional one. The new interface, called the organization interface where results are grouped according to their tradeoff properties, is shown to be significantly more effective in building user trust than the traditional approach. Users perceive it more capable and efficient in assisting them to make decisions, and they are more likely to return to the interface.

A proactive recommendation system (PRS) retrieves information relevant to the written text, and presents it without user intervention. The information presented can improve the quality of the text but can also interrupt the process of writing. We describe two experiments performed to optimize the design of the PRS A Propos. Our goal is to develop a PRS for professional writers that present information non-intrusively and timely so as to minimize disturbing the writing process. The results of our experiments suggest that the tendency to interleave (re)search and writing implies a need for integrating the PRS in a writing environment able to support the task of writing the text itself and the stage of planning the contents and structure of the document. Relevance to industry: While automation has increased the efficiency of repetitive processes, the impact on professional tasks has been minor. Professional writing is a complex task that takes a lot of time. The PRS that we are developing can result in substantial reductions of the cost of writing documents, and in substantial improvements of the quality of the written texts.

Due to actual applications prefer directly item recommendation rather than the item rating and most of the existing systems do not have user explicit ratings on items, in this paper we focus on the implicit feedback on which filtering approach is constructed to provide users with Top-N recommendation. For the special nature of implicit feedback, a binary matrix is used to represent user-item information. On this basis, we analyze the effectiveness of the various existing typical binary similarity methods applied on the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm. Besides, as the current neighbor selection does not take into account the combined effects of neighbors, this paper adopts a new way that considers the neighbor similarity to avoid selecting too similar neighbors. The experiments conducte on the real dataset show that the traditional recommendation performance can be effectively improved by our methods. © 2012 IEEE."

One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre- existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions."

The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development."

Many of the largest commerce Web sites are already using recommender systems to help their customers find products to purchase. A recommender system learns from a customer and recommends products that she will find most valuable from among the available products. In this paper we present an explanation of how recommender systems help E- commerce sites increase sales, and analyze six sites that use recommender systems including several sites that use more than one recommender system. Based on the examples, we create a taxonomy of recommender systems, including the interfaces they present to customers, the technologies used to create the recommendations, and the inputs they need from customers. We conclude with ideas for new applications of recommender systems to E-commerce."

We benchmark our algorithm against a naïve Bayes classifier on the cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general."

In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a rec- ommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation sys- tems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss howto compare recom- menders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application.We focus on comparative studies, where a fewalgorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms.We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms.We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and fi- nally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation.We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties.We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate."

As a result, these approaches consider the userpsilas overall preferences, although the user preferences on items varies according to his/her context. However, in our context-aware approach, we take into account not only user preferences, but also context information. Our approach can be easily adopted for content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendations. To exploit raw context information in recommendation, we abstract the raw context information to a concept level. Moreover, by aggregating the context information, we can improve the quality of recommendation. The results of several experiments show that our method is more precise than the traditional recommendation approaches."

By venture finance, specifically, we are interested in the investment activity of venture capital (VC) firms and their investment partners. We have access to a dataset of recorded venture financings (i.e., investments) by VCs and their investment partners in private US companies. This research was undertaken in partnership with Correlation Ventures, a venture capital firm who are pioneering the use of predictive analytics in order to better inform investment decision making. This paper undertakes a detailed empirical study and data analysis then demonstrates the efficacy of recommender systems in this novel application domain. Copyright 2013 ACM."

However, the ultimate effectiveness of an RS is dependent on factors that go beyond the quality of the algorithm. The goal of an RS is to introduce users to items that might interest them, and convince users to sample those items. What design elements of an RS enable the system to achieve this goal? To answer this question, we examined the quality of recommendations and usability of three book RS (Amazon.com, RatingZone & Sleeper) and three movie RS (Amazon.com, MovieCritic, Reel.com). Our findings indicate that from a user’s perspective, an effective recommender system inspires trust in the system; has system logic that is at least somewhat transparent; points users towards new, not-yet-experienced items; provides details about recommended items, including pictures and community ratings; and finally, provides ways to refine recommendations by including or excluding particular genres. Users expressed willingness to provide more input to the system in return for more effective recommendations."

Recommender systems aim at directing users through this information space, toward the resources that best meet their needs and interests. Web Content Recommendation has been an active application area for Information Filtering, Web Mining and Machine Learning research. Recent studies show that combining the conceptual and usage information can improve the quality of web recommendations. In this paper we exploit this idea to enhance a reinforcement learning framework, primarily devised for web recommendations based on web usage data. A hybrid web recommendation method is proposed by making use of the conceptual relationships among web resources to derive a novel model of the problem, enriched with semantic knowledge about the usage behavior. With our hybrid model for the web page recommendation problem we show the apt and flexibility of the reinforcement learning framework in the web recommendation domain, and demonstrate how it can be extended in order to incorporate various sources of information. We evaluate our method under different settings and show how this method can improve the overall quality of web recommendations. Copyright 2008 ACM."

The fact that it played a central role within the recently completed Netflix competition has contributed to its popularity. This chapter surveys the recent progress in the field. Matrix factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing CF, are described together with recent innovations. We also describe several extensions that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend models accuracy. In passing, we include detailed descriptions of some the central methods developed for tackling the challenge of the Netflix Prize competition."

Collabora- tive Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algo- rithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike at- tributes which are “global” descriptions of items, tags are “local” descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn’t been any prior study on tag- aware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three two- dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investi- gate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algo- rithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporat- ing tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results."

However, accuracy of recommendations and sparsity are still major concerns related to CF recommendation techniques. Recent research in CF is investigating the use of Association Rule Mining (ARM) for extracting high-level information and thereby providing more accurate recommendations. However, determination of the threshold values for support and confidence measures affect the quality of association rules. Moreover, the traditional ARM algorithms are based on market basket analysis and therefore degrade computation efficiency by mining too many association rules which are not appropriate for a given user. The proposed approach attempts to improve the quality of recommendations through the application of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for ARM in the framework of CF. Consequently, by considering support and confidence measures as different objectives, the MOPSO based ARM model extracts only useful and eminent direct association rules which are optimal in the wider sense that no other rules are superior to them when both objectives are simultaneously considered. In addition, computational efficiency is enhanced by mining rules only for the given user and over the related transactional database. Further, the present work explores the indirect (transitive) association between users as well as between items for providing more accurate recommendations even with highly sparse history of transactions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an experimental study using the MovieLens data set. Experimental results clearly reveal that the proposed method consistently outperform other traditional CF based methods as measured by recommendation accuracy, precision, and recall. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V."

For a statistical model-based CF approach, we formally showed that this additional aggregated information provides more accurate recommendations of individual items to individual users. Furthermore, theoretical insights gained from the analysis of this model-based method suggested a way to incorporate aggregate information into the heuristic item-based CF method. Both the model-based and the heuristic item-based CF methods were empirically tested on several datasets, and the experiments uniformly confirmed that the aggregate rating information indeed improves CF recommendations. These results also show the power of theory by demonstrating how the insights gained from theoretical developments can shed light on proper selection of good heuristic methods. We also showed the way to introduce scalability and parallelization into the estimation procedure and reported the running time for steps of the estimation procedure for large datasets."

So far, little research has been done to enable user interaction with such systems as a basis to support exploration and control by end users. In this paper, we present our research on the use of information visualization techniques to interact with recommender systems. We investigated how information visualization can improve user understanding of the typically black-box rationale behind recommendations in order to increase their perceived relevance and meaning and to support exploration and user involvement in the recommendation process. Our study has been performed using TalkExplorer, an interactive visualization tool developed for attendees of academic conferences. The results of user studies performed at two conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces that integrate recommendation technology. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection both increase when users are able to explore and interrelate multiple entities -- i.e. items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags."

In this article, we propose a novel approach for knowledge-assisted, context-aware visualization recommendation. Therefore, both semantic web data and visualization components are annotated with formalized visualization knowledge from an ontology. We present a recommendation algorithm that leverages those annotations to provide visualization components that support the users' data and task. Since new visualization knowledge is generated while working with a visual analytics system due to users insights, particularly a component is suitable or not for a selected dataset, we track these findings by means of users explicit and implicit ratings. This empirical visualization knowledge is reused in subsequent recommendations to better adapt the ranking of components to users needs. We successfully proved the practicability of our approach by integrating it into a mashup-based research prototypes called VizBoard."

While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations.We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms – contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling – for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several context-aware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabilities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising directions for future research"

The approach recommends mobile applications to users based on what other users have installed in a similar context. The idea is to apply a hybrid recommender system to deal with the added complexity of context. We have designed and realized the application to test our ideas. Users can select among several content-based or collaborative filtering components, including a rule-based module using information on point-of-interests in the vicinity of the user, and a component for the integration of traditional collaborative filtering. The implementation is integrated in a framework supporting the development and deployment of mobile services."

That is, to recommend products that the end-user likes, but that are not generally popular. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose two strategies to identify relevant but niche products. The first strategy computes an inverse item popularity and applies it during the steps of top-N recommendation. Given a prior probability distribution of relevance based on item popularity, and a user-specific relevance probability, the other strategy uses a number of scores based on distance measures between these two distributions. We emphasize that the problem is to recommend relevant items from the users broader range of tastes. Hence, in evaluation a concentration index is calculated to measure the extent to which the recommendation is spread to the users niche tastes in conjunction with the standard precision metric which measures the overall relevance of the recommended set. The methods are evaluated empirically using the Movielens dataset and show a strong performance in niche item retrieval at the cost of a small reduction in precision."

We employ a Gaussian random field to model the top-N recommendation task as a semi-supervised learning problem, taking into account the degree of each node on the user-item bipartite graph, and induce an effective absorbing random walk (ARW) algorithm for the top-N recommendation task. Our random walk approach directly generates the top-N recommendations for individuals, rather than predicting the ratings of the recommendations. Experimental results on the two real data sets show that our random walk algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art random walk based personalized ranking algorithm as well as the popular item-based collaborative filtering method."

These tagging systems offer lots of useful information, such as tag, an expression of user's preference towards a certain resource; time, a denotation of user's interests drift. As information explosion, it is necessary to recommend resources that a user might like. Since collaborative filtering (CF) is aimed to provide personalized services, how to integrate tag and time information in CF to provide better personalized recommendations for social tagging systems becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate the importance and usefulness of tag and time information when predicting users' preference and examine how to exploit such information to build an effective resource-recommendation model. We design a recommender system to realize our computational approach. Also, we show empirically using data from a real-world dataset that tag and time information can well express users' taste and we also show that better performances can be achieved if such information is integrated into CF. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our prior work showed that this tradeoff can be managed by applying the contexts differentially in different components of the recommendation algorithm. In this paper, we extend our previous model and show that our differential context relaxation (DCR) model can also be used to identify demographic and item features that are linked to the contexts. We also demonstrate the application of binary particle swarm optimization as a scalable optimization technique for deriving the optimal relaxation."

Current recommender systems often generate recommendation on users' opinions on items, and have several fatal weaknesses. With the growth of web social networks, a new kind of information is available: trust rating expressed by an user on another user. The web-based nature of this information makes it ideal for use in a variety of intelligent systems that can take advantage of the users' social and personal data. In this paper, we analysis the problem of trust in social network, then propose a recommender system model based on social network trust and discuss the recommender methods."

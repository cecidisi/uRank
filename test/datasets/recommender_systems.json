A proactive recommendation system (PRS) retrieves information relevant to the written text, and presents it without user intervention. The information presented can improve the quality of the text but can also interrupt the process of writing. We describe two experiments performed to optimize the design of the PRS A Propos. Our goal is to develop a PRS for professional writers that present information non-intrusively and timely so as to minimize disturbing the writing process. The results of our experiments suggest that the tendency to interleave (re)search and writing implies a need for integrating the PRS in a writing environment able to support the task of writing the text itself and the stage of planning the contents and structure of the document. Relevance to industry: While automation has increased the efficiency of repetitive processes, the impact on professional tasks has been minor. Professional writing is a complex task that takes a lot of time. The PRS that we are developing can result in substantial reductions of the cost of writing documents, and in substantial improvements of the quality of the written texts.

The main goal of traditional collaborative filtering techniques is improvement of the accuracy of recommendation. Nevertheless, such techniques present the problem that they include many items that the user already knows. These recommendations appear to be good when we consider accuracy alone. On the other hand, when we consider users' satisfaction, they are not necessarily good because of the lack of discovery. In our work, we infer items that a user does not know by calculating the similarity of users or items based on information about what items users already know. We seek to recommend items that the user would probably like and does not know by combining the above method and the most popular method of collaborative filtering."

In this article, we review the key advances in collaborative filtering recommender systems, focusing on the evolution from research concentrated purely on algorithms to research concentrated on the rich set of questions around the user experience with the recommender. We show through examples that the embedding of the algorithm in the user experience dramatically affects the value to the user of the recommender. We argue that evaluating the user experience of a recommender requires a broader set of measures than have been commonly used, and suggest additional measures that have proven effective. Based on our analysis of the state of the field, we identify the most important open research problems, and outline key challenges slowing the advance of the state of the art, and in some cases limiting the relevance of research to real-world applications."

One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre- existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions."

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses. In search of better performance, researchers have combined recommendation techniques to build hybrid recommender systems. This chapter surveys the space of two-part hybrid recommender systems, comparing four different recommendation techniques and seven different hybridization strategies. Implementations of 41 hybrids including some novel combinations are examined and compared. The study finds that cascade and augmented hybrids work well, especially when combining two components of differing strengths."

The approach recommends mobile applications to users based on what other users have installed in a similar context. The idea is to apply a hybrid recommender system to deal with the added complexity of context. We have designed and realized the application to test our ideas. Users can select among several content-based or collaborative filtering components, including a rule-based module using information on point-of-interests in the vicinity of the user, and a component for the integration of traditional collaborative filtering. The implementation is integrated in a framework supporting the development and deployment of mobile services."

This observation led us to build a trust model for recommender agents with a focus on the agent's trustworthiness as derived from the user's perception of its competence and especially its ability to explain the recommended results. We present in this article new results of our work in developing design principles and algorithms for constructing explanation interfaces. We show the effectiveness of these principles via a significant-scale user study in which we compared an interface developed based on these principles with a traditional one. The new interface, called the organization interface where results are grouped according to their tradeoff properties, is shown to be significantly more effective in building user trust than the traditional approach. Users perceive it more capable and efficient in assisting them to make decisions, and they are more likely to return to the interface. We therefore recommend designers to build trust-inspiring interfaces due to their high likelihood to increase users' intention to save cognitive effort and the intention to return to the recommender system. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The system employs hybrid techniques from traditional recommender system literature, in addition to a novel interactive interface which serves to explain the recom- mendation process and elicit preferences from the end user. We present an evaluation that compares different interactive and non-interactive hybrid strategies for computing recom- mendations across diverse social and semantic web APIs. Results of the study indicate that explanation and interac- tion with a visual representation of the hybrid system in- crease user satisfaction and relevance of predicted content."

Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can ``intelligently'' determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions. The common solution, ``explicit ratings'', where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise. However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more ``intelligent'' method is to useimplicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user. These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating. Current recommender systems mostly do not use implicit ratings, nor is the ability of implicit ratings to predict actual user interest well-understood. This research studies the correlation between various implicit ratings and the explicit rating for a single Web page. A Web browser was developed to record the user's actions (implicit ratings) and the explicit rating of a page. Actions included mouse clicks, mouse movement, scrolling and elapsed time. This browser was used by over 80 people that browsed more than 2500 Web pages. Using the data collected by the browser, the individual implicit ratings and some combinations of implicit ratings were analyzed and compared with the explicit rating. We found that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling had a strong correlation with explicit interest, while individual scrolling methods and mouse-clicks were ineffective in predicting explicit interest."

One way to build such a model is to ask the user to rate a selection of items. The choice of items selected affects the quality of the user model generated. In this paper, we explore the effects of letting the user participate in choosing the items that are used to develop the model. We compared three interfaces to elicit information from new users: having the system choose items for users to rate, asking the users to choose items themselves, and a mixed-initiative interface that combines the other two methods. We found that the two pure interfaces both produced accurate user models, but that directly asking users for items to rate increases user loyalty in the system. Ironically, this increased loyalty comes despite a lengthier signup process. The mixed-initiative interface is not a reasonable compromise as it created less accurate user models with no increase in loyalty."

Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board. We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems. We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items."

However, current recommender systems are black boxes, providing no transparency into the working of the recommendation. Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation. In this paper, we address explanation interfaces for ACF systems - how they should be implemented and why they should be implemented. To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process. We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some initial explorations into measuring how explanations can improve the filtering performance of users."

So far, little research has been done to enable user interaction with such systems as a basis to support exploration and control by end users. In this paper, we present our research on the use of information visualization techniques to interact with recommender systems. We investigated how information visualization can improve user understanding of the typically black-box rationale behind recommendations in order to increase their perceived relevance and meaning and to support exploration and user involvement in the recommendation process. Our study has been performed using TalkExplorer, an interactive visualization tool developed for attendees of academic conferences. The results of user studies performed at two conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces that integrate recommendation technology. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection both increase when users are able to explore and interrelate multiple entities -- i.e. items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags."

User-based Collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date, and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers that in typical commercial applications can grow to be several millions. To address these scalability concerns item-based recommendation techniques have been developed that analyze the user-item matrix to identify relations between the different items, and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.

Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems."

This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top- N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recom- mender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accu- racy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non- personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, re- gardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other rec- ommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommenda- tion task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods."

The evaluation of the quality of recommender systems has become an important issue for choosing the best learning algorithms. In this paper we propose an evaluation methodology for collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms. This methodology carries out a clear, guided and repeatable evaluation of a CF algorithm. We apply the methodology on two datasets, with different characteristics, using two CF algorithms: singular value decomposition and naive bayesian networks."

Collabora- tive Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algo- rithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike at- tributes which are “global” descriptions of items, tags are “local” descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn’t been any prior study on tag- aware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three two- dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investi- gate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algo- rithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporat- ing tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results."

These tagging systems offer lots of useful information, such as tag, an expression of user's preference towards a certain resource; time, a denotation of user's interests drift. As information explosion, it is necessary to recommend resources that a user might like. Since collaborative filtering (CF) is aimed to provide personalized services, how to integrate tag and time information in CF to provide better personalized recommendations for social tagging systems becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate the importance and usefulness of tag and time information when predicting users' preference and examine how to exploit such information to build an effective resource-recommendation model. We design a recommender system to realize our computational approach. Also, we show empirically using data from a real-world dataset that tag and time information can well express users' taste and we also show that better performances can be achieved if such information is integrated into CF. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Social Filtering (using social\\nnetworks for neighborhood generation) is compared to Collaborative\\nFiltering with respect to prediction accuracy in the domain of rating\\nclubs. After reviewing background and related work, we present an\\nextensive empirical study where over thousand participants from a social\\nnetworking community where asked to provide ratings for clubs in Munich.\\nWe then compare a typical traditional CF-approach to a social\\nrecommender/social filtering approach where friends from the underlying\\nsocial network are used as rating neighborhood and analyze the\\nexperiments statistically. Surprisingly, the social filtering approach\\noutperforms the CF approach in all variants of the experiment. The\\nimplications of the experiment, for professional and private-life\\ncollaborative environments and services where recommendations play a\\nrole are discussed. We conclude with future perspectives on social\\nrecommender systems, especially in upcoming mobile environments."

Recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social media - people and tags. Relationship information among people, tags, and items, is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise. Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest."

While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations.We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms – contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling – for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several context-aware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabilities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising directions for future research"

In that field, collaborative filtering approaches can be distinguished from content-based ones. The former is based on a set of user ratings on items, while the latter uses item content descriptions and user thematic profiles. While collaborative filtering systems often result in better predictive performance, content-based filtering offers solutions to the limitations of collaborative filtering, as well as a natural way to interact with users. These complementary approaches thus motivate the design of hybrid systems. In this chapter, the main algorithmic methods used for recommender systems are presented in a state of the art. The evaluation of recommender systems is currently an important issue. The authors focus on two kinds of evaluations. The first one concerns the performance accuracy: several approaches are compared through experiments on two real movies rating datasets MovieLens and Netflix. The second concerns user satisfaction and for this a hybrid system is implemented and tested with real users."

However, the ultimate effectiveness of an RS is dependent on factors that go beyond the quality of the algorithm. The goal of an RS is to introduce users to items that might interest them, and convince users to sample those items. What design elements of an RS enable the system to achieve this goal? To answer this question, we examined the quality of recommendations and usability of three book RS (Amazon.com, RatingZone & Sleeper) and three movie RS (Amazon.com, MovieCritic, Reel.com). Our findings indicate that from a user’s perspective, an effective recommender system inspires trust in the system; has system logic that is at least somewhat transparent; points users towards new, not-yet-experienced items; provides details about recommended items, including pictures and community ratings; and finally, provides ways to refine recommendations by including or excluding particular genres. Users expressed willingness to provide more input to the system in return for more effective recommendations."

The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs."

Following a brief review of existing approaches to explanation in recommender systems, we focus in this paper on a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to product recommendation that offers important benefits in terms of the ease with which the recommendation process can be explained and the systems recommendations can be justified. For example, recommendations based on incomplete queries can be justified on the grounds that the users preferences with respect to attributes not mentioned in her query cannot affect the outcome. We also show how the relevance of any question the user is asked can be explained in terms of its ability to discriminate between competing cases, thus giving users a unique insight into the recommendation process."

The black-box nature of most CF applications leave the user wondering how the system arrived at its recommendation. This note introduces PeerChooser, a collaborative recommender system with an interactive graphical explanation interface. Users are provided with a visual explanation of the CF process and opportunity to manipulate their neighborhood at varying levels of granularity to reflect aspects of their current requirements. In this manner we overcome the problem of redundant profile information in CF systems, in addition to providing an explanation interface. Our layout algorithm produces an exact, noiseless graph representation of the underlying correlations between users. PeerChooser's prediction component uses this graph directly to yield the same results as the benchmark. User's then improve on these predictions by tweaking the graph to their current requirements. We present a user-survey in which PeerChooser compares favorably against a benchmark CF algorithm."

However, several studies have shown that accu- racy does not always correlate with a better user experience, leading to recent research that puts emphasis on Human- Computer Interaction in order to investigate aspects of the interface and user characteristics that influence the user expe- rience on recommender systems. Following this newresearch this paper presents SetFusion, a visual user-controllable inter- face for hybrid recommender system. Our approach enables users to manually fuse and control the importance of recom- mender strategies and to inspect the fusion results using an interactive Venn diagram visualization. We analyze the re- sults of two field studies in the context of a conference talk recommendation system, performed to investigate the effect of user controllability in a hybrid recommender. Behavioral analysis and subjective evaluation indicate that the proposed controllable interface had a positive effect on the user experi- ence."

Recently, an approach has been taken to service matchmaking based on semantic Web technologies; the designed matching rule can be used to find the sellers' compatible advertisements for buyers. In this paper, we define three categories of attributes for the matchmaking service. Then we present three factors: semantic matching degree, semantic support and relational confidence to capture the semantic characteristics and relationships of the attributes. And we design a semantic ranking MSC combining the three factors to rank the results of advertisements matchmaking. MSC can capture the semantic aspect of matchmaking results; evaluation shows that MSC makes the process of matchmaking more accurately and the advertisement with the highest MSC is better"

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model- based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area. Copyright"

Each textual snippet shows a content summary of the referred document (or webpage) and a link to it. This display has many advantages, for example, it affords easy navigation and is straightforward to interpret. Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query--for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed--the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a \"bag-of-words\" vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown."
